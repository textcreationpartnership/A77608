            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Verily your undeſerved love and reſpects have made me willing to open my boſom to you in this Epiſtle, and in the following Treatiſe, as to Friends that I love and

You are more for the peoples ſake, then the people are for yours: Magiſtrates are Rulers over the perſons of the people, but they are ſervants to the good of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. As it is the duty of all to ſerve them, ſo it is their office to ſerve all. It is no Paradox to affirm, <hi>That Rulers are the greateſt Servants.</hi> The Ancients were wont to place the Statues of their Princes by their Fountains, intimating that they were, or at leaſt ſhould be, Fountains of the Publick good. The Counſellor ſaith, That a man in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick place ſhould give his will to God, his love to his Maſter, his heart to his Countrey, his ſecrets to his Friends, his time to Buſineſs. It is a baſe and unworthy ſpirit, for a man to make himſelf the Centre of all his actions. The very Heathen man could ſay, A Mans Countrey, and his Friends and others challenge a great part of him. The Sun that is the Prince of lights,<note place="margin">So doth the Sea feed and refreſh the ſmaleſt fiſh, as wel as the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Leviathan; the Trees do ſhade and ſhelter from heat the leaſt Bird, as well as the greateſt Beaſt.</note> doth impartially ſerve all, the Peaſant as well as the Prince, the poor as well as the rich, the weak as well as the
<pb facs="tcp:169968:14"/> ſtrong; you muſt be like the Sun. The Sun of Righteouſneſs was of a brave Publick Spirit, he healed others, but was hurt himſelf, he filled others, but was hungry himſelf, he laid out himſelf, and he laid down himſelf for a Publick good. <hi>That Pilot dies nobly</hi> (ſaith <hi>Seneca) who periſheth in the ſtorm with the Helm in his hand.</hi> It is really your praiſe among the Saints, that you have ventured killing, burning, drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and all to ſave the Ship of the Commonwealth from ſinking.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sirs,</hi> Be not weary of Publick Work, it is honor enough that God will make any uſe of you to carry on his deſign in the world; he is a faithful Pay-maſter, Heaven at laſt will make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends for all; you ſhall reap, if you faint not. I do verily believe, God will make uſe of you to do greater things on the Sea, then yet have been done. The Lord hath now begun to ſet a foot upon the Sea, let his enemies tremble, God will not ſuffer his glory to be buried in the deeps; he is a ſhak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Nations, and will not leave ſhaking them, till he that is the deſire of all Nations come. The Lord hath

Now that theſe weak ſoules may be ſtrengthned, that theſe unſtable ſoules may be eſtabliſhed, that theſe diſconſolate ſouls may be comforted, &amp;c. I have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented this Tract to the world, not doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but that if the Lord ſhall draw out their ſpirits to a ſerious peruſal of it, they ſhall find (through the bleſsing of Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah) that it will contribute very much to their attaining of a full Aſſurance of their everlaſting happineſs and bleſſedneſs, as alſo to the keeping and maintaining of that ful and bleſſed Aſſurance; which that it may, I ſhal follow it with my prayers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> I have publiſhed this follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Diſcourſ, remembring that my life is<note place="margin">Jam. 4. 14. Pſal 39. 12.</note> but a vaniſhing vapor, and that the time of my ſojourning in this world will be but
<pb facs="tcp:169968:19"/> ſhort. Mans life is ſo ſhort, that <hi>Auſtine</hi> doubteth, whether to call it a dying life, or a living death. Mans life is but the ſhadow of ſmoke, the dream of a ſhadow. This preſent life is not <hi>(vita, ſed via ad vitam)</hi>
               <note place="margin">Bernard.</note> life, but a motion, a journey towards life; the life of a Chriſtian is rather <hi>(via</hi> then <hi>vita)</hi> a ſtep towards life, then life: Yet do I believe that that is not a death, but life, that joyns the dying man to Chriſt, and that is not a life, but death, that ſeparates the living man from Chriſt.</p>
            <p>I know I ſhall not ſpeak long to Friends, Saints, or Sinners, therefore I was the more willing to take the opportunity of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note place="margin">Heb. 11. 4.</note> to you when I am dead; As <hi>Abel</hi> by his faith (he <hi>being dead) yet ſpeaketh:</hi> So this Treatiſe may ſpeak, and live, when I ſhall return to my long home, and fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 12. 5.

            <head>THE PREFACE touching the nature of Aſſurance.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O be in a ſtate of true Grace, is to be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable no more; it<note place="margin">Pſal. 144. 15. Mal. 3. 17. Rom. 8. 16, 17.</note> is to be happy for ever. A Soul in this ſtate, is a Soul near and dear to God; it is a Soul much beloved, and very highly valued of God; it is a Soul houſed in God; it is a Soul ſafe in everlaſting Arms;<note place="margin">Deut. 33. 26, 27. 1 Cor. 3. 22, 23.</note> it is a Soul fully and eminently intereſted in all the higheſt and nobleſt Priviledges. The being<note place="margin">A man may be Gods, and yet not know it, his eſtate may be good, and yet he not ſee it. Epheſ. 1. 13. 1 John 5. 13. Gal 4. 6.</note> in a ſtate of Grace makes a
<pb facs="tcp:169968:21"/> mans condition happy, ſafe, and ſure; but the ſeeing, the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of himſelf to be in ſuch a ſtate, is, that which renders his life ſweet and comfortable. The being in a ſtate of Grace will yeeld a man a Heaven hereafter, but the ſeeing of himſelf in this ſtate will yeeld him both a Heaven here, and a Heaven hereafter; it will render him doubly bleſt, bleſt in Heaven, and bleſt in his own Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
            <p>Now Aſſurance is a reflex act of a gracious Soul, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he clearly and evidently ſees himſelf in a gracious, bleſſed, and happy ſtate; it is a ſenſible feeling, and an experimental diſcerning of a mans being in a ſtate of Grace, and of his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a right to a Crown of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
<pb facs="tcp:169968:22"/> and this riſes from the ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note place="margin">A man cannot ſee the Sun, but by the light of the Sun.</note> in himſelf, the ſpecial, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar, and diſtinguiſhing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Chriſt, in the light of the Spirit of Chriſt, or from the teſtimony and report of the Spirit of God, the Spirit bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing witneſs with his Spirit, that<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 16, 17.</note> he is a Son, and an Heir appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent to Glory.</p>
            <p>It is one thing for me to have<note place="margin">It is one thing to be an Heir, and another thing to know that one is an Heir; the childe in the Womb, or in the Arms, may be an Heir to a Crown, and yet underſtands it not.</note> Grace, it is another thing for me to ſee my Grace; it is one thing for me to believe, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other thing for me to believe that I do believe; it is one thing for me to have Faith, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other thing for me to know that I have Faith: Now Aſſurance flows from a clear, certain, evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent knowledge that I have Grace, and that I do believe, &amp;c.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:169968:22"/>
            <p>Now this Aſſurance is the beauty and top of a Chriſtians glory in this life; it is uſually attended with the ſtrongeſt joy, with the ſweeteſt comforts, and with the greateſt peace. It is a Pearl that moſt want, a Crown that few wear. His ſtate is ſafe and happy, whoſe Soul is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned with Grace, though he ſees it not, though he knows it not.</p>
            <p>Aſſurance is not of the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of a Chriſtian; it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to the <hi>bene eſſe,</hi> to the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>being, to the comfortable and joyful Being of a Chriſtian, but it is not required to the <hi>eſſe,</hi> to the being of a Chriſtian. A man may be a true Believer, and yet would give all the World, were it in his power, to know that he is a Believer; to have Grace, and
<pb facs="tcp:169968:23"/> to be ſure that we have Grace, is glory upon the Throne, it is Heaven a this ſide Heaven. But more of theſe things you will finde in the following Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, to which I refer you.</p>

It is Chriſt that dyed, yea rather that is riſen againe, who is even at the right hand of God, who alſo maketh interceſsion for us.</hi> It is cleer from theſe words, that this bleſſed A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle<note place="margin">Immediate Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations are fleeting &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtant, and therefore men had need be carefull how they build up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them.</note> had not that glorious <hi>Aſſurance</hi> that he ſpeaks of in the two laſt verſes of this Chapter, by immediate Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, for he concludes it from ſuch arguments as are generall, or common to all the godly; and therefore it roundly follows, that beleevers may in this life attain unto a <hi>Well-grounded Aſſurance</hi> of their everlaſting happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and bleſſedneſſe.

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, It is the very ſcope and end of the Scripture, to help beleevers to a <hi>well-grounded Aſſurance</hi> of their everlaſting happineſſe, and bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Theſe things (ſaith <hi>John) have I written unto you that beleeve on the name</hi>

Grace is Glory in the bud, and Glory is Grace at the full. Now though they had eternal life in all theſe reſpects, yet they did not know it; though they did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, yet they did not beleeve, that they did beleeve; therefore the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle in thoſe precious Epiſtles of his, doth make it his buſineſſe by variety and plenty of arguments to helpe all, but eſpecially ſuch as are weak in the faith, to a <hi>Well-grounded Aſſurance</hi> of their eternal welfare.</p>
               <p>It is the very drift and deſign of the<note place="margin">

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:169968:30"/> may attain to a ſweet <hi>aſſurance</hi> of their everlaſting happineſſe and bleſſedneſſe. Certainly, God is as loving, and his bowels of compaſſion are as ſtrong to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards<note place="margin">Heb. 13. 8.

               <p>Fourthly, God hath by promiſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged himſelfe to aſſure his people of their happineſſe, and bleſſedneſſe, <hi>The</hi>

Men ſay, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay, they eate their words as ſoon as they have ſpoken them: but will God do ſo? Surely no, Hee is faithful that hath promiſed. <hi>All the Promiſes of God in him are</hi> yea, <hi>and in him</hi> Amen, that is, they are ſtable and firme, and ſhall really be made good. The Promiſes are a precious Book, every leaf drops Myrrhe and Mercie: Therefore, ſet down and ſuck at theſe breſts, warme thy ſelf at this fire: God hath been always as good as his word; yea, hee hath ſometimes been better then his word; he hath ever performed, and he hath over performed; hee promiſed the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> only the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> but he gave them, beſides the

How hath God in theſe dayes of darkneſſe and blood, gone beyond the prayers, deſires, hopes, and confidences of his people in this Land? and beyond what we could read in the Book of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes. Satan promiſes the beſt, but payes with the worſt: hee promiſes honour, and pays with diſgrace; hee promiſes pleaſure, and pays with pain; he promiſes profit, and pays with loſſe; he promiſes life, and pays with death: But God pays as he promiſes, all his payments are made in pure gold; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore take theſe promiſes wherein God hath engaged himſelf to aſſure thee of his love, and ſpread them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord, and tell him, that it makes as well for his honour as thy comfort, for his glory as for thy peace, that he ſhould aſſure thee of thy ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting happineſſe and bleſſedneſſe.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, There is in all the Saints the ſprings of aſſurance; and therefore they
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:169968:32"/> may attain to aſſurance: precious Faith is one ſpring of aſſurance, and this is in all the Saints, though in different de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,<note place="margin">

Faith is an appropriating grace, it looks upon God, and ſaith with <hi>David,</hi> this God is my God for ever and ever, and hee ſhall be my guide unto the death. It lookes upon Chriſt, and ſaith with the Spouſe, <hi>I am my Beloveds, and his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire is towards me.</hi> It looks upon an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall crowne and ſaith with <hi>Paul, Henceforth is laid up for me a crown of righteouſneſſe.</hi> It looks upon the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe of Chriſt, and ſaith, this righteouſneſſe is mine to cover me: It looks upon the Mercy of Chriſt, and ſaith, this mercy is mine to pardon me: It looks upon the Power of Chriſt, and ſaith, this power is mine to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port me: It looks upon the Wiſdome of Chriſt, and ſaith, this wiſdome is mine to direct me: It looks upon the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:169968:32"/> blood of Chriſt, and ſayes, this blood is mine to ſave me, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>As Faith, ſo Hope is another ſpring of <hi>Aſſurance, Col. 1. 27. Chriſt in you</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul) the hope of glory.</hi> So <hi>Heb. 6. 19. which hope wee have as an anchor of the ſoule, both ſure and ſtedfaſt, and which entreth into that within the vaile.</hi> Hope taketh faſt hold upon heaven it ſelfe, upon the <hi>ſanctum ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorum.</hi> A Chriſtians hope is not like that of <hi>Pandora,</hi> which may flye out<note place="margin">A Saints motio is, <hi>Spero meliora,</hi> the hypocrites hope is like the morning dew, Job 8. 13, 14.

When <hi>Alexander</hi> went upon a hopefull expedition, hee gave away his gold, and when he was asked what he kept for himſelfe, he anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (<hi>Spem majorum &amp; meliorum</hi>) the hope of greater and better things. So a Chriſtian will part with any thing rather then with his hope; hee knows that hope will keep the heart both from aking, and breaking, from fainting, and ſinking; he knowes that
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:169968:33"/> hope is a beame of God, a ſparke of glory, and that nothing ſhall extinguiſh it, till the ſoul bee filled with glory. Soules that are big in hope, will not be long without ſweet <hi>aſſurance.</hi> God loves not to ſee the hopeing ſoule go alwayes up and downe ſighing, and mourning for want of a good word from heaven, for want of poſſeſſing what it hopes in time to enjoy: hold out hope and patience, a little, little longer, and he that hath promiſed to<note place="margin">Heb. 10. 37. <gap reason="foreign">

I confeſſe it is very ſad to conſider how this precious ſtream of love is even dried up in many.

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE firſt Propoſition that I ſhall lay downe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Aſſurance,</hi> is this, That God denies <hi>Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> for a time to his deareſt and choyſeſt ones, and that upon many conſiderable grounds.</p>
               <p>As firſt, for the exerciſe of their grace; a gracious ſoule would alwayes be upon Mount <hi>Tabor,</hi> looking into <hi>Canaan,</hi> he would alwayes bee in his Fathers arms, and under his Fathers ſmiles, hee would alwayes bee in the Sun-ſhine of divine favour, hee would alwayes have the heavens open, that<note place="margin">

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:169968:44"/> to walke through the valley of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, through the valley of <hi>Baca.</hi> As<note place="margin">Gen. 14. 21. If Saints ſhould alwayes have Aſſurance, they would be too apt to ſay (<hi>bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num eſt eſſe hic</hi>) it is good for us to be here.</note> the King of <hi>Sodome</hi> ſaid once to <hi>Abraham, Give me the perſons, and take the goods to thy ſelfe.</hi> So gracious ſoules are apt to ſay, Give mee joy, give me peace, give me <hi>Aſſurance,</hi> and doe you take trials, afflictions, and temptations, to your ſelves. But pray what uſe would there be of the Starres, if the Sunne did alwayes ſhine? why none; why no more uſe would there bee of your graces, if <hi>Aſſurance</hi> ſhould be alwayes continued; therefore the Lord for the exerciſe of his childrens faith, hope, patience, &amp;c. is pleaſed (at leaſt for a time) to deny them <hi>Aſſurance,</hi> though they ſeek it by earneſt prayer, and with a flood of penitent tears.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Lord denies <hi>Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rance</hi> to his deareſt ones, that he may keep them in the exerciſe of thoſe Religious duties that are moſt coſtly, and contrary to fleſh and blood, as to mourning, repenting, ſelfe-judging, ſelfe-loathing, ſelfe-abhorring, and ſelfe-ſearching; As that 1 <hi>Sam. 16.

               <p>Now if you aske me why God will put his children upon thoſe duties of Religion that are moſt coſtly and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:169968:45"/> contrary to fleſh and blood:</p>
               <p>I anſwer firſt, That <hi>his ſtrength and power may appear in their weakneſſe,</hi> 2 Cor. 12. 7, 8, 9.</p>
               <p n="2">2 To diſcover not onely the truth, but alſo the ſtrength of their graces; a little grace will put a man upon thoſe Religious duties that are eaſie, and pleaſing to fleſh and blood, and not chargeable, but rather profitable, and pleaſureable, but it muſt bee ſtrength of grace that puts a man upon thoſe ſervices that are coſtly and croſſe to the <hi>Old man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3 That they may bee more fully and eminently conformable to Chriſt their Head, who from firſt to laſt, who even from the cradle to the croſſe was moſt exerciſed in thoſe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and ſervices that were moſt coſtly and croſſe to fleſh and blood, as is moſt evident to all that ſtudy the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the Holy Ghoſt, more then the writings of men.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Becauſe in the performance of ſuch duties they do in a more ſingular way bear up the name and credit, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and glory of God, Chriſt and the Goſpel in the world; the very
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:169968:45"/> world will cry out, Ah theſe are Chriſtians indeed.</p>
               <p n="5">5 Becauſe the more they are in the exerciſe of ſuch duties, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, at laſt, will be their reward.</p>
               <p n="6">6 That Satans plots, and deſignes<note place="margin">Heb. 11. 7.</note> may be the better prevented, and the wicked world more juſtly condemned, who doe not onely deſpiſe the hardeſt duties of Religion, but alſo neglect<note place="margin">Mat. 25. 4. 46.</note> the eaſieſt.</p>
               <p>The third Reaſon why God denies <hi>Aſſurance</hi> to his moſt precious ones, is,<note place="margin">Ier. 2. 19.</note> that they may be the more cleerly and fully convinced of that exceeding ſinfulneſſe, and bitterneſſe that is in ſinne. Ah Lord, ſayes the ſoule, that ſits ſighing and mourning, under the want of <hi>Aſſurance,</hi> I ſee now that ſinne is not onely evil, but the greateſt evill in the world, in that it keeps mee from an <hi>Aſſurance</hi> of my intereſt in thee who art the greateſt good in the world, and from an <hi>Aſſurance</hi> of that favour of thine that is better then life,<note place="margin">Sin is, <hi>Malum Catholicum;</hi> Tis <hi>aeterna macula;</hi> Tis <hi>corruptio optimi pesſima.</hi> Pſ. 63. 3, 4. Pſ. 4 7.</note> and from the light of thy ſweet countenance, that is better then corne and wine, and oyle; and from thoſe joyes and comforts that can onely
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:169968:46"/> make a Paradiſe in my ſoule. Ah<note place="margin">This made one cry out, <hi>Quid reſtat O peccator, niſi ut in tota vita tua deplores rotam vitam tuam;</hi> O what then remains but in our whole life to lament the ſins of our whole life.</note> Lord now I finde ſinne not onely to bee bitter, but to bee the very quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſſence of bitterneſſe: Ah, no bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe ſo bitter as ſinne, that keeps my ſoule from that ſweet <hi>aſſurance,</hi> that is not onely the top and crowne of mercy, but alſo the ſweetner of all mercie, miſery, and glory. Oh what unſpeakable evill do I now ſee in that evil that keeps me from the moſt deſirable good. Oh what bitterneſſe do I now find in that which Satan, the<note place="margin">Heb. 3. 13.

Yea <hi>peccatum eſt Deicidium,</hi> Sin is a killing of God.</note> world, and my owne deluded heart told me I ſhould finde ſweetneſſe in. Ah, now I finde by experience, that to be true, which long ſince the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Meſſengers of the Lord have told me, <hi>viz.</hi> That ſinne debaſeth the ſoule of man, that it defiles and pollutes the ſoule of man, that it renders the ſoule moſt unlike to God, (who is <hi>opti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum maximum</hi>) the beſt and greateſt, who is (<hi>omnia ſuper omnia</hi>) all, and above all, and renders it moſt like to Satan, who is a very ſea and ſinke of ſinne. That it hath robbed the ſoule of the image of God, the holineſſe of God, the beauty of God, the glory
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:169968:46"/> of God, the righteouſneſſe of God, and that keepes the ſoule from wearing this Golden Chaine of <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A fourth reaſon, why God denies <hi>Aſſurance</hi> to his deareſt ones, is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Christus op er noſtra non tam actibus quam finibus penſat. Zanchius,</hi> The glory of God muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume all other ends, as the Sun puts our the light of the fire.</note> they ſeeke <hi>Aſſurance</hi> more for themſelves, then they doe for his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and glory; more that they may have joy without ſorrow, comfort without torment, peace without trouble, ſweet without bitter, light without darkneſſe, and day without night; then that he may bee exalted and admired, and his name alone made great and glorious in the world.</p>
               <p>Many Chriſtians are like the Bee that flyes into the field to ſeek honey to eat, but brings it not into the Maſters hive; So they ſeek for <hi>Aſſurance,</hi> that they may feed upon that ſweet hony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comb, more, then to fill their Lord and Maſters hive with thanks and praiſe.</p>
               <p>That ſervant that mindes his wages more then his worke, muſt not won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if his Maſter be ſlacke in paying; no more ſhould hee that mindes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:169968:47"/> more then obedience, that minds<note place="margin">It was a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table ſaying of <hi>Nazianzen,</hi> Let me (ſayes he) be caſt into the Sea, let me loſe my place rather then the name of Chriſt ſhould ſuffer; ſo tender was he of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and glory of Chriſt.</note> 
                  <hi>aſſurance</hi> more then divine honour, wonder that God delayes the givings in of <hi>aſſurance,</hi> though it bee ſought with many prayers and teares. He that is moſt tender of Gods ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, ſhall finde by experience that God is moſt mindful of his comfort. God will not ſee that ſoule fit long in ſackcloath and aſhes, that makes it his buſineſſe to ſet him up upon his Throne. He that minds Gods glory, more then his owne good, ſhall quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly finde that God will even obſcure his owne glory to doe him good. If wee are not wanting to Gods glory, he will not long bee wanting to our joy.</p>
               <p>A fifth reaſon why God denies <hi>Aſſurance</hi> to his children, is, that when they have it, they may the more highly prize it, the more carefully keep it, the more wiſely improve it, and the more affectionately and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually bleſſe God for it; none ſets ſuch a price upon light, as hee that hath laine long in a Dungeon of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe:<note place="margin">Life without light, is but a life-leſſe life. Mich 7. 8, 9.</note> So none ſets ſuch a price upon <hi>Aſſurance,</hi> as thoſe children of light
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:169968:47"/> that have walked moſt in ſpirituall darkneſſe. Ah! how ſweet was the<note place="margin">Jonah 2 2.</note> light to <hi>Jonah</hi> that had been in the belly of hell; ſo is <hi>Aſſurance</hi> to thoſe that (through ſlaviſh fears, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beliefe) <hi>have made their beds in hell,</hi> as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſpeaks.

               <p>Firſt, Sometimes (I ſay not always) at firſt converſion, the Lord is pleaſed to make out ſweet manifeſtations of his love to the penitent ſoul; when the ſoul hath been long under guilt and wrath; when the ſoul hath been long under the frowns and diſpleaſure

               <p>Firſt, That they may not be ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up of ſorrow, nor give up the ghoſt under the pangs and throws of the new birth: Ah, did not the Lord ſet in ſome beams of love upon the ſoul, when it is (<hi>magor Miſſabib</hi>) a
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:169968:66"/> terrour to its ſelf, when the heart is a hell of horrour, the conſcience an<note place="margin">An awakned conſcience is like <hi>Promethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> Vulture, it lies ever gnaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> 
                  <hi>Acheldema,</hi> a Field of black blood, when the ſoul is neither quiet at home, nor abroad, neither at Bed, nor Board, neither in company, nor out of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, neither in the uſe of Ordinances, nor in the neglect of Ordinances, how would the ſoul faint, ſink, and deſpair for ever? But now when it is thus night with the ſoul, the Lord ſweetly comes in, and tells the ſoul, that all is well, that he hath found a ranſom for<note place="margin">Job 33. 24.</note> the ſoul, that the Books are croſt, that all debts are diſcharged, and that his favor and love upon the ſoul is fixed: And ſo God by his ſweet and ſtill voice, ſpeaking thus to the ſoul, quiets and ſatisfies it, and keeps it from ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and deſpairing.</p>
               <p>Secondly, God gives in aſſurance ſometimes at firſt converſion, that he may the more raiſe and inflame their love and affections to him. Ah! How does a pardon given in, when a man is ready to be turned off, draw out his love, and raiſe his affections to that Prince that ſhews bowels of mercy, when he is upon the brink of miſery:

The Lord knows that when hee ſets upon the delivering of a poor ſoule from the Kingdome of darkneſſe, and tranſlating it into the Kingdome of his dear Sonne, that Satan will roar and<note place="margin">Col. 1. 13.</note> rage, rend and tear, as he did him in.<note place="margin">

This poor childe had never ſo ſore a fit as now he was neareſt the cure; when rich Mercy, and Glorious power is neareſt the ſoul, then Satan moſt ſtorms, and rages againſt the ſoul.

But that no ſoul may miſtake this laſt Propoſition, give me leave to premiſe theſe two Cautions.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That God does manifeſt his<note place="margin">Caut. 1.</note> love onely to ſome, at their firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, not to all: Though he dearly loves every penitent ſoul, yet he does not manifeſt his love, at firſt converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to every penitent ſoul. God is a
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:169968:69"/> free Agent to work where he will, and when he will, and to reveal his love, how he will, and when he will, and to whom he will. It is one thing for<note place="margin">A man may enjoy the warmth and heat of the Sun, when he cannot ſee the Sun; ſo a man may have grace, when he cannot ſee that he hath grace.</note> God to work a work of Grace upon the ſoul, and another thing for God to ſhew the ſoul that work. God of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes works Grace in a ſilent and ſecret way, and takes ſometimes five, ſometimes ten, ſometimes fifteen, ſometimes twenty years, yea, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times more, before he will make a clear and ſatisfying report of his own work upon the ſoul. Though our Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces be our beſt Jewels, yet they are ſometimes, at firſt converſion, ſo weak and imperfect, that we are not able to ſee their luſtre. The being of Grace, makes our eſtates ſafe and ſure, the ſeeing of Grace, makes our lives ſweet and comfortable.</p>
               <p>The ſecond <hi>Caution</hi> is this: A man<note place="margin">

                     </gap> Divine love hath a compulſive fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, it is very powerful to put the ſoul upon acting in the higheſt and hardeſt ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices for Chriſt.</note> ſweet taſte of Heaven before hand: Now he ſmiles, now he kiſſes, now he embraces the ſoul, now he takes a Saint by the hand, now he cauſes his goodneſs and glory to paſs before the ſoul, now he opens his boſom to the ſoul, now the ſoul ſhall be of his Court and Councel, now the Clouds ſhall be ſcattered, now it ſhall be no longer night with the ſoul, now the ſoul ſhall ſit no longer mourning in the valley of darkneſs, now Chriſt will carry the ſoul up into the Mount, and there reveal his glory to it, that it may act high and brave, noble and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, in the face of difficulties and diſcouragements. Chriſt did intend to<note place="margin">Matth. 17. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.</note> put <hi>Peter, James,</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> upon hard and difficult ſervice; and therefore brings them up into an high mountain, and there gives them a viſion of his Beauty and Glory; there they ſee him transfigured, metamorphoſed, or trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, there they ſee his face ſhining as the Sun, and his Rayment gliſtering. In the Mount, he ſhews them ſuch
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:169968:70"/> beams of his Deity, ſuch ſparkling glory, as did even amuſe them, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maze them, tranſport them, and aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh them; and all this Grace and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, this Goodneſs and Sweetneſs Chriſt ſhews them, to hearten and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage them, to own him and his truth, to ſtand by him and truth, to make him and his truth known to the world, though hatred, bonds, and contempt did attend them in ſo doing. Thus God dealt with <hi>Paul,</hi> before he<note place="margin">Acts 9. 1, to 23.</note> put him upon that hard and dangerous ſervice, that he had cut out for him; he takes him up into Heaven, and ſheds abroad his love into his heart, and tells him, That he is a choſen Veſſel; he appears to him in the way, and fills him with the Holy Ghoſt, that is, with the gifts, graces, and comforts of the Holy Ghoſt. And ſtraightway he<note place="margin">

               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:169968:71"/>
               <p>And this hath been the conſtant<note place="margin">It is ſufficient to point at theſe inſtances, they are ſo notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly known to all that know any thing of the Scripture in power.

And this hath made

               <p>Firſt, That they may not faint nor <label type="milestone">

The beſt and ſweeteſt
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:169968:96"/> flowers of paradiſe, God gives to his people when they are upon their knees. Prayer is (<hi>Porta coeli, clavis pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſi</hi>) the Gate of Heaven, a Key to let us into paradiſe: when <hi>John</hi> was weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (in prayer, doubtleſs) the Sealed Book was open to him. Many Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans have found by experience, praying times to be ſealing times, times where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in God hath ſealed up to them the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of their ſins, and the ſalvation of their ſouls: They have found prayer to be a ſhelter to their ſouls, a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to God, a ſweet ſavor to Chriſt, a ſcourge to Satan, and an in-let to aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. God loves to lade the wings of prayer with the choiceſt, and chiefeſt bleſſings. Ah! how often, Chriſtians, hath God kiſt you at the beginning of prayer, and ſpoke peace to you in the midſt of prayer, and filled you with joy and aſſurance, upon the cloſe of prayer.

A deſpairing ſoul is a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to others, but the greateſt burden to it ſelf, it is ſtill a vexing, terrifying, tormenting, condemning, and perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it ſelf: Deſpair makes every ſweet<note place="margin">A deſpairing ſoul is like the ſpider that draws poyſon out of the ſweeteſt flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</note> bitter, and every bitter exceeding bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it puts Gall and Wormwood in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſweeteſt Wine, and it puts a ſting, a croſs into every croſs.

               <p>Tell me, O deſpairing ſouls, is not deſpair an exceeding vile and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible ſin, is it not a diſhonor to God, a reproach to Chriſt, and a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer of ſouls, is it not a belying of God, a denying of Chriſt, and a crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Satan; it doth without doubt proclaim the Devil, a Conqueror, and lifts him up above Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Deſpair is an evil that flows<note place="margin">Deſpair is Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece, it carries men he adlong to hell, it makes a man twice told a childe of hell; it is a Viper, that hath ſtinged many a man to death.</note> from the greateſt evil in the world, it flows from unbelief, from igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and miſ-apprehenſions of God, and his Grace, and from miſtakes of Scripture, and from Satan, who being for ever caſt out of paradiſe, labors with all his art and might to work poor ſouls to deſpair of ever entring into paradiſe. O deſpairing ſouls, let the greatneſs of this ſin effectually awaken you, and provoke you to labor as for life, to come out of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, which is as ſinful as it is
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:169968:105"/> doleful, and as much to be hated, as to be lamented.</p>
               <p>Again, tell me, O deſpairing ſouls,<note place="margin">Acts 2. <hi>Plus peccavit</hi> Judas <hi>deſperan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do quàm pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dendo Chriſtum,</hi> ſaith one.</note> hath not deſpairing <hi>Judas</hi> periſhed; when as the murderers of Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving on him were ſaved.

O deſpairing ſouls, the arms of mercy are open to receive a <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> a Monſter, a Devil incarnate; he cauſed that Goſpel Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> to be ſawed in the midſt with a Saw (as ſome Rabbins ſay;) he turned aſide from the Lord to commit<note place="margin">2 Chro 33. 1, to 15.</note> Idolatry, and cauſed his ſons to paſs thorow the fire, and dealt with famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar ſpirits, and made the ſtreets of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> to overflow with innocent blood.

                  <note place="margin">Mark 6. 9.</note> was full of Devils, and yet Chriſt caſts them out, and made her heart, his houſe, his preſence Chamber; why doſt thou then ſay there is no hope for thee, O deſpairing ſoul? <hi>Paul</hi> was full<note place="margin">Acts 1. 1, 2. &amp; 26. 11.</note> of rage and malice againſt Chriſt, his people, and ways, and he was full of blaſphemy, and impiety, and yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,

Though the Prodigal<note place="margin">Luke 15. 13, 14.</note> had run from his Father, and ſpent, and waſted all his eſtate in ways of baſeneſs, and wickedneſs, yet upon his reſolution to return, his Father meets him, and inſtead of killing him, he kiſſes him, inſtead of kicking him,<note place="margin">Verſ. 22, 23.</note> he embraces him, inſtead of ſhutting the door upon him, he makes ſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous proviſions for him. And how then doſt thou dare to ſay, O deſpairing ſoul! that God will never caſt an eye of love upon thee, nor beſtow a crumb of mercy on thee.

<pb n="160" facs="tcp:169968:106"/> and ſanctified by the Spirit of Chriſt, and decked, and adorned with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Graces of Chriſt. Therefore<note place="margin">O deſpairing ſouls, are you good at burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that you have no mercy on your ſelves, but to argue to your own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing.</note> do not ſay, O deſpairing ſoul, that thou ſhalt die in thy ſins, and lie down at laſt in everlaſting ſorrow. Did it make for the honor and glory of his free grace to pardon them; and will it be a reproach to his free-grace, to pardon thee? Could God be juſt in juſtifying ſuch ungodly ones, and ſhall he be unjuſt in juſtifying of thee? Did not their unworthineſs and unfitneſs for mercy, turn the ſtream of mercy from them? No. Why then, O de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpairing ſoul, ſhouldſt thou fear that thy unworthineſs, and unfitneſs for mercy, will ſo ſtop and turn the ſtream of mercy, as that thou muſt periſh eternally for want of one drop of ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Grace and Mercy.</p>
               <p>Again, tell me, O deſpairing ſoul! Is not the Grace of God free-grace, is<note place="margin">

In King <hi>James</hi> his time, there was one Miſtreſs <hi>Honi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi> of <hi>Kent,</hi> an ancient and religious Gentlewoman, who lived many years
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:169968:114"/> in much horror and terror of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, for want of aſſurance of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor of God, and of her eternal wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>being. She would very often cry out, <hi>She was damned; ſhe was damned.</hi> Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral men of eminent piety and parts, left no means unattempted, whereby her doubts might be anſwered, her conſcience pacified, and her ſoul ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and cheared; yet ſhe being ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly under the power of deſpair, perſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in crying out, <hi>O ſhe was damned, ſhe was damned.</hi> When theſe Gentlemen<note place="margin">The truth of this whole ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly known.</note> were about to depart, ſhe called for a Cup of Wine for them, which being brought, ſhe drank to one of them a glaſs of the Wine, and as ſoon as ſhe had done, in an extream paſſion ſhe threw the Venice-glaſs againſt the ground, ſaying, <hi>As ſure as this glaſs will break, ſo ſurely am I damned.</hi> The glaſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded from the ground without any harm, which one of the Miniſters ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly caught in his hand, and ſaid, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, a miracle from Heaven to confute your unbelief, O tempt God no more, tempt God no more.</hi> Both the Gentlewoman, and all the company, were mightily a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed at this ſtrange accident, and all
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:169968:114"/> glorified God for what was done; and the Gentlewoman by the grace and mercy of God, was delivered out of her Hell of deſpair, and was filled with much comfort, and joy, and lived, and died full of peace and aſſurance.</p>
               <p>Take another inſtance. There lived lately at <hi>Tilbury</hi> in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> a Gentleman who was a long time under ſuch an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent degree of deſpair, that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected all comfort that was tendered to him by any hand, and would not ſuffer any to pray with him; nay, he ſent to the Miniſters and Chriſtians that lived near him, and did deſire them that as they would not increaſe his torments in Hell, they would ceaſe praying for him; he would not ſuffer any religious ſervice to be performed in his family, though formerly himſelf was much in the uſe of them; yet God gave him at laſt ſuch inward re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhings, and by degrees filled him with ſuch abundance of heavenly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorts (as he told all that came to him) that it was impoſſible for any tongue to utter, or heart to imagine, that did not feel them; at laſt God gave him
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:169968:115"/> the new name, and the white ſtone, that none knows, but he that hath it. He lived about three quarters of a year enjoying Heaven upon Earth, and then breathed out his laſt in the boſom of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Poor I, that am but of yeſterday, have known ſome that have been ſo deeply plunged in the gulf of deſpair, that they would throw all the Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Cordials that have been tendered to them againſt the walls; they were ſtrong in reaſoning againſt their own ſouls, and reſolved againſt every thing that might be a comfort and ſupport unto them; they have been much ſet againſt all Ordinances and Religious Services; they have caſt off holy Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties themſelves, and peremptorily refuſed to joyn with others in them; yea, they have out of a ſenſe of ſin and wrath, which hath lain hard upon them, refuſed the neceſſary comforts of this life, even to the overthrow of natural life: And yet out of this hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Pit, this Hell upon Earth, hath God delivered their ſouls, and given them ſuch manifeſtations of his grace and favor, that they would not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:169968:115"/> them for a thouſand worlds. O deſpairing ſouls, deſpairing ſouls, you ſee that others, whoſe conditions have been as bad, if not worſe then yours, have obtained mercy, God hath turned their Hell into a Heaven, he hath remembred them in their low eſtate, he hath pacified their raging conſciences, and quieted their diſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſouls, he hath wiped all tears from their eyes, and he hath been a well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of life unto their hearts: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be not diſcouraged, O deſpairing ſouls, but look up to the Mercy-ſeat, remember who is your Reſt, and kick no more by deſpair, againſt the bowels of Divine love.</p>

Are there not many doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſouls that wait upon God, in hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Word of Life, and yet neglect, and make light of waiting upon Chriſt, in breaking the Bread of Life? Are there not many that are very careful daily to perform Family duties, and yet are very rarely found in Cloſet ſervices? Some there be that are all ear, all for hearing; and others there be, that are all tongue, all for ſpeaking and praying; and others there be, that are all eye, all for believing, all for ſearching, all for enquiring into this, and that; and others there be, that are all hand, all for receiving the Lords Supper, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And ſeriouſly, when I conſider theſe things, I ceaſe wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that ſo many want Aſſurance, and do rather wonder, that any obtain Aſſurance, conſidering how few there be, that are conſcientious and ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

               <p>Well doubting ſouls, remember this, God will give Aſſurance in one Ordinance, when he will deny it in another, that you may ſeek his face in all. God loves as well, that you ſhould wait on him, as that you ſhould wreſtle with him. He that will not give God the honor of attending him, in every duty, in every Ordinance, may long enough complain of the want of Aſſurance, before God will give him the white ſtone, and the new name, that none knows but he that hath it. Many of the precious Sons of <hi>Zion</hi> have found God giving Aſſurance in one Ordinance, others have found him giving Aſſurance in another Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance. God ſpeaks peace to ſome in ſuch and ſuch ſervices, and comfort to others in ſuch and ſuch duties: Therefore as you would have Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, O doubting ſouls, ſeek the Lord in every way and ſervice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wherein he is pleaſed to make known his glory and goodneſs. In hearing Chriſt opens

               <p>The fourth Motive to provoke you<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Motive</hi> 4. The Heathens (as many Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors now) had not the right art of mortifying ſin, (<hi>Sapientia eorum plerumque ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcondit vitia, non abſcindit.</hi>) All their wiſdom was to hide a luſt, not to quench it; therefore their joy was like the crackling of thorns un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a pot.</note> to be the death of your darling ſins, is, Solemnly to conſider, that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, and effectual mortifying of one boſom ſin, will yeeld a Chriſtian more glorious joy, comfort, and peace, then ever he hath found in the gratifying, and committing of all other ſins. The pleaſure and ſweetneſs that follows victory over ſin, is a thouſand times beyond that ſeeming ſweetneſs that is in the gratifying of ſin: The joy that attends the ſubduing of ſin, is a noble joy, a pure joy, a peculiar joy, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing joy, and a laſting joy; but that joy that attends the committing of ſin, is an ignoble joy, a corrupt joy, a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing joy, a dying joy; the truth is, were there the leaſt real joy in ſin, there could be no perfect Hell, where men ſhall moſt perfectly ſin, and be moſt perfectly tormented with their
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:169968:132"/> ſin. Ah doubting Chriſtians, as ever<note place="margin">The Leper un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law, was ſtill to keep his hair ſhaven. Levit. 14 5.

Remember this, nothing below the conqueſt of boſom ſins, can make a jubilee in the heart; it is not a mans whining and complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over ſin, but his mortifying of ſin that will make his life a paradiſe of pleaſure. If notwithſtanding all that hath been ſaid, you are ſtill reſolved to dally with ſin, then you muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to live as a ſtranger to God, and as a ſtranger to aſſurance and peace. You muſt expect ſad trials without, and ſore troubles within; you muſt expect to finde Satan playing his part both as a Lion, and as a Serpent, both as a Devil, and as an Angel of light; you muſt expect either no news from Heaven, or but bad news from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; and you muſt expect that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience<note place="margin">Conſcience is <hi>Index, Judex, Vindex.</hi>
                  </note> will play the part, both of a ſcolding Wife, and of a Lion, that
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:169968:133"/> wants his prey. And this ſhall be your juſt reward for playing with ſin; if you like the reward, then take your courſe, and dally with ſin ſtill; if o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, then ſacrifice your <hi>Iſaac.</hi>

               <p>The fifth Motive to work you to<note place="margin">

Ah, how would you live and love upon a dying day? how would you admire God, reſt upon God, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in God, long for God, and walk with God upon a dying day? how would you hate, loath, and abhor your boſom ſins upon a dying day? how would you complain of your bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom ſins, and pray againſt your boſom ſins, and mourn over your boſom ſins, and watch againſt your boſom ſins, and flie from all occaſions that ſhould tend to draw you to cloſe with your boſom ſins, upon a dying day? Ah doubting ſouls, would you not for all the world gratifie your boſom ſins upon a dying day, and will you gratifie them on other days; which for any
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:169968:133"/> thing you know to the contrary, may prove your dying days? Thrice happy is that ſoul that labors with all his might, to do that at firſt that he would fain do at laſt; that doth that on every day, that he would give a thouſand worlds to do on a dying day. No way to Aſſurance like this; no way to joy and comfort, like this; no way to reſt and peace, like this; no way to the Kingdom, to the Crown, like this. I earneſtly beſeech you trembling ſouls, when you finde your ſpirits running out to boſom ſins, that you would lay your hands upon your hearts, and thus expoſtulate the caſe: O our ſouls, would you thus dally and play with ſin upon a dying day? would you thus ſtroke and hug ſin upon a dying day? would you not rather ſhew all the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like and hatred that is imaginable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it? would you not tremble at ſin more then at Hell, and abhor the very occaſions of ſin, more then the moſt venomous Serpent in all the world? would you not rather ſuffer the worſt and greateſt puniſhments, then to ſmile upon a darling ſin upon a dying day? Yes. O would you fain
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:169968:134"/> do this upon a dying day; why not then every day? why not then every day, O our ſouls?</p>

This age is full of ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flatterers, of ſoul-undoers, who like evil Chyrurgions skin over the wound,

Flattery undid <hi>Ahab,</hi> and <hi>Herod,</hi> and <hi>Nero,</hi> and <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander.</hi> Thoſe flatterers that told <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyſius,</hi> that his Epiſtle was as ſweet as<note place="margin">

And ah how many yong and old in theſe days have been loſt and undone, by thoſe ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flatterers that lie in wait to enſnare and deceive the ſouls of men. Oh that this very conſideration might be ſet home by the hand of the Spirit, with that life and power, upon your ſouls, as effectually to ſtir and provoke you to get a wel-grounded aſſurance of your happineſs and bleſſedneſs, that ſo you may ſtand faſt, like the houſe built upon the Rock, in the midſt of all<note place="margin">Matth 7. 24, 25.</note> tempeſts and ſtorms, that nothing may unſettle you, nor diſquiet you, and that none may take away your Crown.<note place="margin">Revel 3. 11.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The third Motive to ſtir you up to<note place="margin">Motive 3.</note> get a wel-grounded aſſurance, is this, Conſider that a wel-grounded aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of your happineſs and bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:169968:141"/> will eaſe you, and free you of a threefold burden: It will free you, firſt, from a burden of cares; ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, from a burden of fears; thirdly, from a burden of doubts. Now the burden of cares, Ah Chriſtian<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> cauſes thee to ſit down ſighing and groaning;<note place="margin">Matth. 13. 22.</note> ah, how doth the cares of getting this and that, and the cares of keeping this and that worldly content, diſturb and diſtract, vex and rack the ſouls of men, that live under the power of carking cares. Oh, but now aſſurance of better things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> makes the ſoul ſing care away, as that Martyr ſaid, <hi>My</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

                  <hi>ſoul is turned to her reſt, I have taken a ſweet nap in Chriſts lap; and therefore, I will now ſing away care, and will be careleſs according to my name.</hi> Aſſurance of a Kingdom, of a Crown, is a fire that burns up all thoſe cares that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily fill the head and diſtract the heart. There is no way to get off the burden of cares, but by getting aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. Again, Aſſurance will free you from the burden of fears, as well as from the burden of cares. Now your hearts are filled with fears of poſſeſſing the Creature, with fears of
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:169968:142"/> wanting the Creature, with fears of loſing the Creature, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And theſe fears makes many men turn like the <hi>Chamelion,</hi> into all coulors, forms, and<note place="margin">And men are apt to make Elephants of Flies, and Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants of Pig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, till men reach aſſurance they will ſtill crea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Oh, but now aſſurance will ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all theſe fears, as the Sun doth the Clouds; it will extinguiſh theſe fears, as the Sun doth the Fire. Aſſurance made <hi>David</hi> divinely fearleſs, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely careleſs: <hi>Yea, though I walk thorow the valley of the ſhadow of death, I will fear no evil; for thou art with me, thy rod, and thy ſtaff, they comfort me.</hi> Ah, how full of fears, and perplexities<note place="margin">Gen. 21. 16, 19. Vide.</note> was <hi>Hagar,</hi> till the Lord opened her eyes to ſee the Well of Water that was neer her. So the ſoul will be full of fears and perplexities, till it comes to ſee aſſurance, to enjoy aſſurance. Chriſtians, When all is ſaid, that can be, this will be found at laſt a moſt certain truth, That there is no way to be effectually rid of your fears, but by obtaining a wel-grounded aſſurance of your happineſs and bleſſedneſs. Again, Aſſurance will rid you of your burden of doubts; now you are ſtill a doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; ſometimes you doubt, whether
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:169968:142"/> that you are a thorow Chriſtian, and<note place="margin">Remember Chriſtians, firſt, that doubts are bred and fed by ignorance, and unbelief, and therefore are ſinful. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that they rob the ſoul of all joy, comfort, and content. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they render Men Babes in Chriſtianity. Fourthly, they throw reproach upon God, Chriſt, and the Promiſes. Fifthly, they give Satan the greateſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage againſt us.</note> not an <hi>Agrippa,</hi> an almoſt-Chriſtian, an half-Chriſtian, as moſt Profeſſors are; ſometimes you doubt of your Sonſhip, and that leads you to doubt of your Heirſhip; ſometimes you doubt of your acquaintance with God, and that leads you to doubt of your acceſs to God, and acceptance with God; ſometimes you doubt of your union with God, and thoſe doubts lead you to doubt of the truth of your communion with God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The truth is, your whole life is a life of doubting, and ſo it will be, till you reach to a wel-grounded aſſurance. Though the two Diſciples had Chriſt for their companion, yet their hearts were full of fears and doubts, whileſt their eyes were held, that they ſhould not know him, <hi>Luke 24. 14, 15, &amp;c.</hi> Till a Chriſtians eyes be open to ſee his aſſurance, his heart will be full of doubts and perplexities. Though<note place="margin">John 20. 13, 14, 15, 16.</note> 
                  <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> was very near to Chriſt, yet ſhe ſtands ſighing, mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and complaining, that they had ſtoln away her Lord, becauſe ſhe did not ſee him. Chriſtians, though you may
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:169968:143"/> be very near and dear to Chriſt, yet till you come to ſee your aſſurance, you wil ſpend your days in doubting, mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and complaining. The ſum of all, is this, As you would be rid of your burden of cares, your burden of fears, and your burden of doubts, get a wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded aſſurance of your happineſs and bleſſedneſs; but if you are in love with your burdens, then neglect but the making of your Calling and Election ſure, and you ſhall certainly make ſure your burdens; they ſhall riſe with you, and walk with you, and lie down with you, till they make your lives a Hell.</p>
               <p>The fourth Motive to provoke you<note place="margin">Motive 4.</note> to labor after a wel-grounded aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, is, To conſider that Satan will labor with all his art and craft, with all his power and might, to keep you from attaining a wel grounded aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of your happineſs and bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Such is Satans envy and enmity againſt a Chriſtians joy and comfort, that he cannot but act to the utmoſt of his line, to keep poor ſouls in doubts and darkneſs. Satan knows that aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:169968:143"/> is a Pearl of price that will make the ſoul happy for ever; he knows that aſſurance makes a Chriſtians wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs to be a paradiſe; he knows that aſſurance begets in Chriſtians, the moſt noble and generous ſpirits; he knows that aſſurance is that which will make men ſtrong to do exploits, to ſhake his tottering Kingdom about his ears, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And therefore he is very ſtudious and induſtrious to keep ſouls<note place="margin">It is ſaid of <hi>Marcellus</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, that he could not be quiet (<hi>Nec victor, nec victus,</hi>) nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conquered nor conqueror. Satans envy is ſuch againſt the joy and comfort of the Saints, that he cannot reſt, nor ceaſe from making uſe of all his wiles, whereby poor ſouls may be kept off from aſſurance, and their lives made a burden to them.</note> off from aſſurance, as he was to caſt <hi>Adam</hi> out of Paradiſe. It is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that Satan, who envied the firſt ſeeds of Grace, that divine Love ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in thy ſoul, that he ſhould envy the increaſe of thy grace, yea, thy aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, which is the top and royaltie of grace. When thou waſt a Babe, Satan caſt water upon thy ſmoaking flax, that it might not flame forth into aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance; and now thou art grown up to ſome more maturity, he is raiſed in his enmitie; ſo that he cannot but put out his power and policy to keep thee from aſſurance of felicitie and glory. Satan envies thy candle-light, thy torch-light, thy ſtar-light, how much more, that the Sun ſhould ſhine upon
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:169968:144"/> thee. Satan envies thy eating of the crums of Mercy under the Table, how much more, that as a childe thou ſhouldſt ſit at Wiſdoms Table, and eat and drink abundantly of Wiſdoms delicates. Satan envies thy feeding up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Husks among the Swine, how much more that thou ſhouldſt eat of the fatted Calf. Satan envies thy fitting with <hi>Mordecai</hi> at the Kings Gate, how much more that thou ſhouldſt wear the Kings Robes. Satan envies thy taſting of the leaſt drop of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, how much more thy ſwimming in thoſe pleaſures that be at Gods right hand for evermore. He envies thy ſitting upon Gods knee, how much more then thy lying in his boſom. He envies thy being admitted into his ſervice, how much more that thou ſhouldſt be of his Court and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel. Some ſay of the Cryſtal, that it hath ſuch a vertue in it, that the very touching of it quickens other ſtones, and puts a luſtre and beautie upon them. Aſſurance is that Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Cryſtal that quickens ſouls, and that caſts a beautie and a glory upon ſouls; and this makes the Devil mad.
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:169968:144"/> Satan knows that aſſurance is Manna in a Wilderneſs, it is water out of a Rock, it is a cloud by day, and a pillar of fire by night: He knows that aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is Salve for all ſores, and Phyſick for all diſeaſes, and a Remedy againſt every malady: He knows that aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is a Chriſtians Anker at Sea, and his Shield upon Land; and that it is a Staff to ſupport him, and a Sword to defend him, and a Pavillion to hide him, and a Cordial to cheer him. And therefore it is, that he labors, both as a Lion, and as a Serpent, to keep poor ſouls from a wel-grounded aſſurance. This Son of the Morning is faln from the top of Glory, to the bottom of miſery; and therefore he ſtrives to make all as miſerable and unhappy as himſelf.</p>
               <p>Ah Chriſtians, have not you need<note place="margin">It is a true Maxime, He findes his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my ſtrong, at a dear rate, who contemns him as weak.</note> to ſeek Aſſurance with all your might, who have to do with ſo mightie an adverſary, who cares not what tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments he heaps upon himſelf, ſo he may prove your tormentor, by keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your ſouls and aſſurance aſunder. O that this very conſideration might make you reſtleſs, till you have

               <p>The fifth Motive to provoke you to<note place="margin">Motive 5.</note> get a wel-grounded aſſurance, is this, Conſider that a wel-grounded aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is a Jewel of that incomparable value; it is ſuch a Pearl of price, as will abundantly recompence the ſoul for all the coſt and charge it ſhall be at, to enjoy it; I, the enjoyment of<note place="margin">

Surely the Gold in the Mine will recompence the Digger, the Crown at the end will recompence the Runner, the Fruit in the Vineyard will recompence the Dreſſer, the Corn in the Barn will recompence the Reaper, and the increaſe of the Flock will recompence the Shepherd; ſo Aſſurance at laſt will abundantly recompence the ſoul for all its knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, weeping, and waiting at Mercies

God will never ſuffer the Seed<note place="margin">Iſai. 45. 19.</note> of <hi>Jacob</hi> to ſeek his face in vain: There is a reward not onely in keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,<note place="margin">Pſal. 19. 11.</note> but alſo for keeping of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. <hi>Joſeph</hi> for his thirteen years<note place="margin">Matth. 25. 34, to 41.

The three Children for taking a few turns in the Fiery Furnace, are advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to great dignitie and glory. Ah doubting ſouls, pray hard, pull hard, work hard for Aſſurance, the pay will anſwer the pains, Chriſt will ſooner or later ſay to thee, as the King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſaid to the King of <hi>Syria, I am</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The ſixth Motive to provoke you<note place="margin">Motive 6.</note> to get Aſſurance, is this, Conſider what labor, and pains, worldlings take<note place="margin">Scripture and Hiſtories a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds with inſtances of this kinde, as all know that know any thing of the one, or of the other.</note> to make ſure the things of this life, to them and theirs. Ah what riding, running, plotting, lying, ſwearing, ſtabbing, and poyſoning, is uſed by men of this world, to make ſure the poor things of this world, that are
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:169968:146"/> but ſhadows, and dreams, and meer nothings? How do many with <hi>Samſon</hi> lay heap upon heap, to make their Crowns and Kingdoms ſure, to make the tottering glory of this world ſure to themſelves? what bloody butchers do they prove, they will have the Crown, though they ſwim to it tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row blood? Men will venture life and limb, to make ſure theſe things that hops from man to man, as the Bird hops from twig to twig. O, how ſhould this ſtir and provoke us to be up and doing, to labor as for life, to make ſure ſpiritual and eternal things. Is Earth better then Heaven? is the<note place="margin">Matth 6. 19, 20. <hi>The laborious, the active Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian is tempted but by one De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, but the idle ſlothful Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian is tempted by all,</hi> ſaith one.

<pb n="242" facs="tcp:169968:147"/> hell, then you are to make ſure thoſe things that would be your joy and crown, in life, in death, and in the day of your account. <hi>Pambus</hi> in the Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory, wept when he ſaw a Harlot dreſſed with much care and coſt, partly to ſee one take ſo much pains to go to Hell, and partly becauſe he had not been ſo careful to pleaſe God, as ſhe had been to pleaſe a wanton lover. Ah Chriſtians, what great reaſon have you to ſit down and weep bitterly, that worldlings take ſo much pains to make themſelves miſerable, and that you have taken no more pains to get aſſurance, to get a pardon in your boſoms, to get more of Chriſt into your hearts?</p>
               <p>The ſeventh Motive to provoke you<note place="margin">Motive 7.</note> to get Aſſurance, is, To conſider that Aſſurance will inable you to bear a burden without a burden. As in <hi>Heb. 10. 34. For ye had compaſsion of</hi>
                  <note place="margin">So <hi>Moſes,</hi> and all thoſe Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies in the eleventh chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</note>

<pb n="243" facs="tcp:169968:147"/> theſe Worthies, patiently, and joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully bear a burden without a burden. So the Apoſtles knowing, <hi>that they</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 1. &amp; 6. 8, 9, 10, 11.</note> 
                  <hi>had a houſe not made with hands eternal in the Heavens, went thorow honor and diſhonor, evil report, and good report.</hi> They went thorow many weakneſſes, ſickneſſes, wants, and deaths; they had nothing, and yet poſſeſt all things; they had burden upon burden, caſt upon them by the Churches, by falſe Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and by an uncharitable world; and yet they chearfully bore all bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens without a burden, thorow the power of a wel-grounded aſſurance. Aſſurance makes heavy afflictions<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4. 16, 17, 18.</note> light, long afflictions ſhort, bitter af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions ſweet. Where a man wants aſſurance, there the ſhadow of a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den frights him, and the weight of the leaſt burden ſinks him; ſuch a man is ſtill a crying out, No mans burdens to my burden, my burden is greater then others, my burden is heavier then others. The want of aſſurance often times makes mens very mercies a burden, their comforts a burden, their relations a burden, yea, their very lives a burden unto them.<note place="margin">Job 7 20.</note>
                  <pb n="244" facs="tcp:169968:148"/> Ah Chriſtians, you will never bear burdens without a burden, till you come to attain an aſſurance of better things: This will inable you to leap under the weight of any croſs, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce under the weight of any Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. Aſſurance fits a mans heart to his condition, and when a mans heart is fitted to his condition, nothing proves a burden to him. Aſſurance of better<note place="margin">I have read of <hi>Albas Paulus</hi> who handled Serpents and Scorpions, and cut them in pieces without any hurt, and ſaid, If a man be holy, all things are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to him as to <hi>Adam,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his ſin in paradiſe. Surely aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able a man to do much this way.</note> things takes away the ſting, the poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that attends theſe lower things; and the ſting, and the poyſon being taken away, the very worſt of theſe things, are ſo far from being a burden to a man, that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come rather a pleaſure, and a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light unto him. When the ſting is taken out of this, or that venomous Creature, a man may play with it, and put it in his boſom. Ah, aſſurance pulls out the ſting that is in every croſs, loſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And this makes the aſſured ſoul to ſit down ſinging, when others under far leſs croſſes and loſſes, ſits down ſighing, mourning and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining, <hi>Our burdens are greater then we are able to bear.</hi> If there were but more aſſurance of better things among
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:169968:148"/> Chriſtians, there would be leſs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints among them of this burden, and that Mole-hills then would be no longer Mountains. Chriſtians, it is not new notions, new opinions, new nothings (as I may ſay) in your heads, but the gaining of a wel-grounded aſſurance in your hearts, that will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able you to bear all kinde of burdens without a burden.</p>
               <p>The eighth Motive to provoke you<note place="margin">Motive 8.</note> to get aſſurance, is drawn from thoſe particular commands of God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he engages Chriſtians to get aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance;<note place="margin">The Saints in Heaven have <hi>felix neceſsitas</hi> an happy ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, but we <hi>infelix neceſsitas</hi> an unhappy neceſſity of diſobeying continually.

Take one command, and charge that upon the heart; if the heart be ſtout, and will not yeeld, then take another command, and preſs that upon the heart; if that will not do it, then take another, and lay that home upon the heart, and never leave this work, till your ſouls be effectually ſtirred up to labor for aſſurance, with all your might. Chriſtians,) on ſhould tell your ſouls, that the commands of God, binds directly and immediately, that they binde abſolutely and univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally. You muſt obey God <hi>intuitu vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntatis,</hi> upon the bare ſight of his Will, and in one thing as well as an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. Chriſtians, if I am not much miſtaken, you ſhould make as much conſcience of thoſe commands of God, that requires you to get aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of your future happineſs, as you do of thoſe commands that requires you to pray, to hear, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is very ſad to conſider, that many that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:169968:150"/> much of the want of aſſurance, ſhould make no more care and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of thoſe commands of God, that requires them to get aſſurance, then ſome of the Heathens have done of the commands of their gods; who when they have called for a man, have offered a candle, or as <hi>Hercules,</hi> who offered a painted man, in ſtead of a living. Verily Chriſtians, while you make light of any of Gods commands, God will make as light of your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts. Did you make more conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to act anſwerable to the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned commands, I am very apt to believe, that the Sun of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, would certainly and ſpeedily cauſe his love, and glory to beam out upon you. Minde Gods commands more then your own wants and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, and light will break in upon you. By obeying Chriſts commands, you ſhall gain more then you can give, by kiſſing the Son you ſhall even com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand him, and make him and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance yours.</p>
               <p>The ninth Motive to provoke you<note place="margin">Motive 9.</note> to get aſſurance, is this, You cannot
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:169968:151"/> gratifie Satan more, nor injury your ſelves more, then by living without aſſurance; by living without aſſurance, you lay your ſelves open to all Satans ſnares and temptations; yea, you do inſtigate and provoke Satan to tempt you to the worſt of ſins, to tempt you to the greateſt neglects, to tempt you to the ſtrangeſt ſhifts, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce you to the ſaddeſt ſtraits. Ah Chriſtians, in what, in what hath Satan ſo gratified you, that you ſhould thus gratifie him; hath he not rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you of your glory in innocency? hath he not kept your ſouls and your Saviour long aſunder? when with <hi>Joſhua</hi> you have been ſtanding before<note place="margin">Zech. 3. 1, 2.</note> the Lord? hath not he ſtood at your right hand, as an adverſary to reſiſt you? hath he not often ſet the glory<note place="margin">Matth. 4.</note> of the world before you, that he might bewitch you, and enſnare you? hath he not often caſt water upon thoſe Divine Motions, that hath been<note place="margin">1 Theſ. 2. 18.</note> kindled in you? have you not often <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="249" facs="tcp:169968:151"/> aſſurance. He that lives without aſſurance, lives without a comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able fruition of God, and ſo gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifies Satan: He that lives without aſſurance, lives upon ſome Creature-enjoyment, more then upon God, and ſo gratifies Satan: He that lives without aſſurance, lives not like the beloved of God, and ſo gratifies Satan: He that lives without aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, is very apt to gratifie Satan, ſometimes by complying with him, ſometimes by following after him, and ſometimes by acting his part for him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Verily Chriſtians, there is no way effectually to prevent this ſore evil, but by getting a wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded aſſurance of your Everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Happineſs and Bleſſedneſs. Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance will make a man ſtand upon terms of defiance with Satan, it will make the ſoul conſtant in reſiſting, and happy in over-coming the evil one. And aſſured ſoul will fight it out to the death with Satan; an aſſured ſoul will not flie like a coward, but will ſtand and triumph like a <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as you gratifie Satan by living
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:169968:152"/> without Aſſurance, ſo you wrong your own ſouls by living without aſſurance,<note place="margin">

A man that lives without aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance lies his precious ſoul open to many blows and knocks, to many frowns and wounds, from God, from the world, from carnall friends, from hypocrites, and from Satan. Therefore as you would not, Chriſtians, gratify Satan, and wrong your own ſoules, and exerciſe over your ſelves, ſpirituall cruelty and tyranny, which is the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry worſt of all cruelty and tyranny; give God no reſt till hee hath made known to you the ſweetneſſe of his love, and the ſecrets of his boſome; till he hath gathered you up into him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; till he hath ſet you <hi>as a ſeal upon</hi>

               <p>The tenth <hi>Motive</hi> to provoke you<note place="margin">Motive 10.</note> to get a wel-grounded aſſurance, is this, conſider the ſweet profit and glorious advantage that will redown to you by
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:169968:152"/> gaining aſſurance, and if the gain that will certainly redown to you by aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, will not provoke you to get aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance, I know not what will.</p>
               <p>Firſt, It will bring down Heaven in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your boſomes, it will give you a<note place="margin">Heb. 11. 1</note> poſſeſſion of Heaven, on this ſide hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; an aſſured ſoul lives in Paradiſe and walks in Paradiſe, and works in Paradiſe, and eats in Paradiſe, and reſts in Paradiſe; hee hath Heaven within him, and Heaven about him, and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven over him, all his language is Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, heaven; Glory, glory.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Aſſurance will exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſweeten all the changes of this life; this life is full of changes, Aſſurance will ſweeten ſickneſs and health, weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4. 16, 17, 18.</note> and ſtrength, wants and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, diſgrace and honour, &amp;c. while a man lives in the ſenſe of unchangea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble loves, no outward changes can make any conſiderable change in his ſpirit; Let times change, let men change, le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Thirdly, Aſſurance will keep the heart from an inordinate running out after the World, and the glory thereof. <hi>Moſes</hi> having an aſſurance of the recompence of a reward, and<note place="margin">Heb 11. 24, 25, 26, 27.</note> of his love and favor, that is inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, could not be drawn by all the honors, pleaſures, and treaſures of <hi>Egypt:</hi> He ſlights all, and tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples upon all the glory of the world, as men trample upon things of no worth.

                  </note> when the Diamond is in preſence, no more cannot the vanities of this world draw the ſoul after them, when Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:169968:154"/> that choice Pearl of price is in preſence. I have read of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> that after he was raiſed from the Grave, he was never ſeen to ſmile; the aſſurance that he had of more glorious things, did deaden his heart to the things of this world; he ſaw nothing in them worthy of a ſmile. Ah were there more aſſurance among Chriſtians, there would not be ſuch tugging for the world, and ſuch greedy hunting and purſuing after it, as is in theſe days, to the diſhonor of God, the reproach of Chriſt, and the ſhame of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.<note place="margin">Juſtice would not be ſold and bought, as it is in theſe days, were there more aſſurance in the world.</note> Get but more aſſurance, and leſs money will ſerve your turns; get but more aſſurance, and leſs places of honor and profit will ſerve your turns; get but aſſurance, and then you will neither tranſgreſs for a morſel of Bread, nor yet violently purſue after the Golden Wedge, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, Aſſurance will exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly heighten you in your communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with God, and it will exceedingly<note place="margin">1 John 1. 1, 2, 3, 4.</note> ſweeten your communion with God.

<pb n="256" facs="tcp:169968:154"/> choice and ſweet communion with God, as thoſe that have the cleareſt aſſurance of their intereſt in God; as may be ſeen thorowout the whole Book of <hi>Solomons Song. My beloved</hi>

The Wives aſſurance of her intereſt in her Husband, ſweetens and heightens her communion with her Husband<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Childes aſſurance of his intereſt in his Father, ſweetens his commerce and fellowſhip with his Father: So the Believers aſſurance of his intereſt in God, will exceedingly heighten and ſweeten his communion and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with God. Aſſurance of a mans intereſt in God, ſweetens every
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:169968:155"/> thought of God, and every ſight of God, and every taſte of God, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very good Word of God. God is as<note place="margin">

               <p>Fifthly, Aſſurance will be a choyce preſervative to keep you from back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſliding from God and his wayes: Ah <hi>Aſſurance</hi> will glue the ſoul to God and his wayes, as <hi>Ruth</hi> was glued to her Mother <hi>Naomi;</hi> It will make a man <hi>ſtand faſt in the Faith, and quit himſelf like a good Souldier of Chriſt, 2 Pet. 1. 10, 11. Wherefore the rather Brethren, give</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luther</hi> writing to his friend <hi>Melancthon</hi> troubled with fears, ſaith (<hi>Si nos ruimas ruit &amp; Chriſtus</hi>) If we fall, ſaith he, Chriſt falls.</note>

Aſſurance will keep a man from falling foully, and from falling utterly. Verily, the reaſon why
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:169968:155"/> there is ſo many Apoſtates in theſe days, is, becauſe there are ſo few that have a wel-grounded aſſurance in theſe days. <hi>Pliny</hi> ſpeaks of ſome fiſhes that ſwim back-ward. Ah many Profeſſors<note place="margin">

Believe it Friends, it is not high notions in the Brain, but found aſſurance in the heart, that will keep a man cloſe to Chriſt, when others back-ſlide from Chriſt. An aſſured Chriſtian will not exchange his Gold for Copper, he knows that one old peece of Gold is worth a thouſand new Counters: One old truth of Chriſt, is worth a thouſand new errors, though cloathed with gliſtering Robes; and therefore he will prize the truth, and own the truth, and keep cloſe to the truth, when others that want a ſound aſſurance, make merchandize of Chriſt, precious<note place="margin">2 Pet. 2. 3.</note> truths, and of their own and others immortal ſouls. Get aſſurance, and thou wilt ſtand, when ſeeming Cedars fall; want aſſurance, and thou canſt
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:169968:156"/> not but fall to the breaking of thy bones, if not to the utter loſs of thy precious ſoul.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, Aſſurance will very much imbolden the foul with God, it will make a man divinely familiar with God, it will make a man knock bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at the door of Free-grace, it will make a man come boldly before the Mercy-ſeat, it will make a man enter boldly within the Holy of Holies, <hi>Heb. 10. 22.

Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> under the power of aſſurance, lets fall this tranſcendent rapture of a during Faith (<hi>Fiat mea voluntas,) Let my will be done,</hi> and then falls off ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (<hi>Mea voluntas domine quia tua,) My will Lord, becauſe thy will.</hi> It is the want of aſſurance that makes the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance ſad, the hands hang down, the knees feeble, and the heart full of<note place="margin">Heb. 12. 12.</note>
                  <pb n="259" facs="tcp:169968:156"/> fears and tremblings. O therefore get aſſurance, and that will ſcatter your fears, and raiſe your hopes, and chear your ſpirits, and give wings to Faith, and make you humbly bold with God. You will not then ſtand at the door of Mercy, with a may I knock, with a may I go in, with a may I finde audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and acceptance; but you will with <hi>Eſther,</hi> boldly adventure your ſelves upon the Mercy and Goodneſs of God.</p>

               <p>The aſſured Soul knows, that Death ſhall be the Funeral of all his ſins and ſorrows, of all afflictions and temptations, of all deſertions and oppoſitions. He knows that Death ſhall be the Reſurrection of his joyes, he knows that death is both an out-let, and an in-let, an out-let to ſin, and an in-let to the ſouls clear, full, and conſtant injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God.

<pb n="261" facs="tcp:169968:157"/> Death, that is loth to go to Chriſt. So I may be with Chriſt, though I go in a Cloud, I care not, ſayes the aſſured ſoul; ſo I may be with Chriſt, I care not, though I go in a Fiery Charriot, ſayes the aſſured ſoul. The <hi>Perſians</hi> had a certain day in the year, in which they uſed to kill all Serpents, and venomous Creatures; The aſſured Chriſtian knows, that the day of Death will be ſuch a day to him, and that makes Death love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and deſirable; he knows that Sin<note place="margin">Morimur dum non morimur.</note> was the Midwife that brought Death into the World, and that Death ſhall be the Grave to bury Sin.<note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>And therefore Death is not a terror, but a delight unto him; he fears it not as an enemy, but wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes it as a friend. As Crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back <hi>Richard</hi> the Third, in his diſtreſs cried, <hi>A Kingdom for a Horſe, a Kingdom for a Horſe:</hi> So ſouls that want aſſurance when they come to die, will cry out, A Kingdom for Aſſurance, a Kingdom for Aſſurance. And as <hi>Severus</hi> ſaid, <hi>If I had a thouſand worlds, I would now give them all for
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:169968:158"/> Chriſt;</hi> So a Soul that wants Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance when he comes to enter upon a ſtate of eternity, will cry out, O had I now a thouſand worlds, I would give them all for aſſurance; whereas the aſſured ſoul would not for a thouſand worlds but die. When his glaſs is out, and his ſun is ſet, he cryes not out, as that Lady did, A World, a World, for an inch of time; but rather, why is it, why is it Lord, that thy chariots be ſo long a coming?</p>
               <p>Eightly, Aſſurance will very much ſweeten that little oyl that is in the<note place="margin">1 King. 17. 12, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>And hence it is, that aſſured ſouls<note place="margin">Prov. 15. 16.</note> live ſo ſweetly, and walk ſo chearfully, when their little all is upon their backs, and in their hands; whereas the great men of the world, that have the world at will, but want this aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance (that is more worth then the world) live as ſlaves and ſervants to their mercies; in the midſt of all their abundance they are in ſtraits and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities,<note place="margin">Job 20. 22.</note> full of fears, and cares, and nothing pleaſes them; nor is ſweet unto them, becauſe they want that<note place="margin">A Believer knows, 1.

Aſſurance<note place="margin">We are united in the ſame Head and Hope, (<hi>Eodem ſanguine Chriſti glutinati.</hi>) We are cemented with the ſame blood of Chriſt, as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaid of his friend <hi>Alypius,</hi> and himſelf.</note> makes men of a God-like diſpoſition, eaſie to pardon, ready to forgive, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant in goodneſs, admirable in patience: It makes men to ſtudy the good of others, and joy in all oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities, wherein they may ſtrengthen the feeble, and comfort the dejected, and enrich the impoveriſhed, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the ſeduced, and enlarge the ſtraitned, and build up the waſted. Verily, the reaſon why men are ſo bitter, and ſowre, and cenſorious, is,
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:169968:161"/> Becauſe God hath not given into their boſoms this ſweet flower of delight, Aſſurance.</p>
               <p>Ah were their ſouls fully aſſured, that God had loved them freely, and received them graciouſly, and juſtified them perfectly, and pardoned them abſolutely, and would glorifie them everlaſtingly. They could not but love where God loves, and own where God owns, and embrace where God embraces, and be one with every one, that is one with Jeſus. Were there<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Magnes amoris eſt amor.</hi> Love is the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone of love.</note> more aſſurance among Chriſtians, there would be more of <hi>Davids</hi> and <hi>Jonathans</hi> ſpirit, among Chriſtians, then there is this day; were there more aſſurance among Chriſtians, there would be more life, and more love, more ſweetneſs, and more ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs; were there more aſſurance, there would be leſs noiſe, leſs conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, leſs diviſion, leſs diſtraction, leſs biting, and leſs devouring among the Saints. Aſſurance will make the Lion and the Calf, the Wolf and<note place="margin">Iſai. 11. 6, 7, 8.</note> the Lamb, the Leopard and the Kid, the Bear and the Cow, lie down toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and feed together. Men that
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:169968:161"/> want aſſurance, love their Brethren as Flies love the Pot; ſo long as there is any meat in the Pot, the Flies love it; ſo thoſe men will love, as long as there is an external motive to draw love, but when that ceaſes, their love ceaſes. <hi>Dionyſius</hi> loved his bottles, when they were full, but hurled them away when they were empty; ſo many that want aſſurance, love the Saints while their bags are full, and their houſes full of the good things of this life; but when they are empty, then they throw them away, then they caſt them off, as <hi>Jobs</hi> friends did him.</p>
               <p>Ah but aſſurance will make a man love as God loves, and love as long as God loves. The aſſured Chriſtian will not ceaſe to love, ſo long as the leaſt Buds and Bloſſoms of Grace appears. <hi>Lazarus</hi> in his rags, is as lovely to an aſſured Chriſtian, as <hi>Solomon</hi> in his robes. <hi>Job</hi> is as delightful to him upon the dung-hil, as <hi>David</hi> is upon his throne. It is not the outward pomp and bravery, but the inward beauty and glory of Saints that takes the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured Chriſtian.</p>
               <pb n="270" facs="tcp:169968:162"/>
               <p>The laſt Motive to provoke you to<note place="margin">Motive 11.</note> get a wel-grounded aſſurance of your Everlaſting Happineſs, is this, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that as there is a great deal of counterfeit knowledge, counterfeit faith, counterfeit love, counterfeit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the world, ſo there is a great deal of counterfeit aſſurance in the world: Many there be that talk high, and look big, and bear it out bravely, that they are thus and thus, and that they have ſuch and ſuch glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious aſſurance; whereas when their aſſurance comes to be weighed in the ballance of the Sanctuary, it is found too light; and when it comes to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand temptations, it is found too weak; and when it ſhould put the ſoul upon Divine action, it is found to be but a lazy preſumption. Shall the counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit gold that is in the world, make men active and diligent to get that which is currant, and that will abide the Touchſtone, and the Fire? and ſhall not that counterfeit aſſurance, that is in the world, provoke your hearts to be ſo much the more careful and active to get ſuch a wel-grounded aſſurance, that God accounts as cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:169968:162"/> and that will abide his Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone in the day of diſcovery, and that will keep a man from ſhame and bluſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when the Thrones ſhall be ſet, and the Books ſhall be opened? I have been the longer upon theſe Motives to provoke your ſouls to get a wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded aſſurance, becauſe it is of an eternal concernment to you, and a work, to which mens he arts are too backward, though aſſurance carries a reward in its own boſom, yet few look out after it; though the pains of getting it, be nothing to the profit that accompanies it; yet few will ſweat to gain it. If the inducements laid down, will not awaken and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke you to be reſtleſs, till you have got the White ſtone, and New name, till you have got the aſſurance of your pardon in your boſoms, I know not what will.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> Shewing the ſeveral Ways and Means of gaining a wel-grounded Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Irſt, if ever you will attain<note place="margin">Means 1.</note> to Aſſurance, then be much in the Exerciſe and Actings of Grace, as the believing <hi>Epheſians</hi> were<note place="margin">Epheſ. 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 13. A Chriſtian that would have aſſurance, muſt never leave blowing his little ſpark, till he hath blowed it into a flame.</note> in the very Exerciſe and Actings of Grace; the Spirit of the Lord ſealed them up to the day of Redemption. Aſſurance flows in upon the actings of Grace; aſſurance is bred, and fed, it is raiſed and maintained in the ſoul by the actings of Grace. Grace is moſt diſcernable, when it is moſt in action; and Grace is made more and more perfect by acting: Neglect of your Graces, is the ground of their decreaſe. Wells are the ſweeter for drawing; you get nothing by dead and uſeleſs Habits. Talents hid in a Napkin, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ruſt; the nobleſt faculties are imbaſed, when not improved. Grace
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:169968:163"/> in the habit, is no more diſcernable, then fire under the aſhes, then gold in the Ore, then a dead man in the grave; but Grace in its lively actings and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, is as a Prince upon his throne, ſparkling and ſhining. Ah Chriſtians, were your grace more active, it would be more viſible; and were your grace more viſible, your aſſurance would be more clear and full. As Saint <hi>Paul</hi> once ſpake to <hi>Timothy, Stir up the gift</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Tim. 1. 6. The words are an alluſion to the fire in the Temple, which was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to be kept burning. <hi>Vide Calvin</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Text.</note> 
                  <hi>of God that is in thee.</hi> So I ſay to you, if ever you would have aſſurance, ſtir up the grace of God that is in you, blow up that heavenly fire, raiſe up thoſe noble ſpirits, never ceaſe belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, nor repenting, till it be clearly given into your boſome, that you are ſure that you do believe, and that you do repent, as you are ſure that you live, as you are ſure that God rules in <hi>Jacob,</hi> and dwells in <hi>Zion.</hi> Remember Chriſtians, all the honor that God hath from you in this life, is from the actings and the exerciſe of your grace, and not from the habits of grace. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member Chriſtians, that all your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations flow not from the habits, but from the acts of grace. Remember
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:169968:164"/> Chriſtians, that the want of the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of grace, is the reaſon why you do not diſcern your grace, and why you have no more aſſurance of your future happineſs. He that will be rich, muſt ſtill be turning the peny, and he that will attain unto the riches of aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance,<note place="margin">Col. 2. 2.</note> muſt ſtill be acting his graces; there are none but lively active Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, that knows and feels thoſe joys, comforts, and contents, that attends the exerciſe of grace. If thou wouldſt not be always a Babe in Grace, and a ſtranger to Aſſurance, then ſee that thy Lamp be always burning, ſee that the Golden Wheels of Grace be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways going.</p>
               <p>Secondly, If you would, Chriſtians,<note place="margin">Means 2.</note> attain unto aſſurance, then you muſt minde your work more then your wages; you muſt be better at obeying, then at diſputing; at doing, at walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, then at talking, and wrangling. Aſſurance is heavenly wages that Chriſt gives, not to loyterers, but to holy laborers; though no man merits aſſurance by his obedience, yet God uſually crowns obedience with aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.

Now thoſe choice ſouls that thus walks according to the Law of the new Creature, ſhall have peace and mercy in them, and peace and mercy with them, and peace and mercy on them: As many as walk according to this rule, peace and mercy be on them. Aſſurance is a jewel of too high a price, to be caſt into any of their boſoms that walk con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Laws of the new Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; ſuch may talk of aſſurance, and make a ſtir and a noiſe about aſſurance, but it is the cloſe walking Chriſtian that ſhall be crowned with aſſurance. Aſſurance is a choice part of a Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vis nunquam eſſe triſtis bene vive.</hi> Wouldſt thou never be fact, then live well, ſays <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard.</hi>

Theſe are the perſons that ſhall have the honor to have Gods ear, and the happineſs to know his heart.</p>
               <p>The third Means to gain aſſurance,<note place="margin">Means 3.</note> is, To be kinde to the Spirit, hear his voice, follow his counſel, live up to his Laws: The Spirit is the great Revealer of the Fathers ſecrets; he lies in the boſom of the Father; he knows every name that is written in the Book of Life; he is beſt acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the inward workings of the heart of God, towards poor ſinners;<note place="margin">Rom. 8. John 14.</note> he is the great Comforter, and the onely Sealer up of ſouls to the day of Redemption. If you ſet him a mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note place="margin">Eph. 1. 13.</note> by your wilful ſinnings, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone can glad you, by whom will you be gladed. Verily, Chriſtians, when you turn your back upon the Spirit,
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:169968:166"/> he will not turn his face upon your ſouls; your vexing of the Spirit will<note place="margin">Iſai. 63. 10.</note> be but the diſquieting of your ſelves. Look as all lights cannot make up the want of the light of the Sun, ſo all Creatures cannot make up the want of the teſtimony of the Spirit. Let me ſpeak to you, as God once ſpake to his people in that of <hi>Exod.</hi> 23. 20, 21,<note place="margin">This Angel is the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, as Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors do gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally agree. <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Ah Chriſtians, the way to aſſurance, is, Not to ſit down ſighing and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining of the want of aſſurance, but it lies in your eying of the Spirit, in your complying with the Spirit, in your cleaving to the Spirit, in your following of the Spirit, in your wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming of the Spirit, and in your honoring and obeying of the Spirit. As he ſaid of the ſword of <hi>Galiah,</hi> none like to that. So I ſay, no mans like to this, to gain a wel-grounded
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:169968:167"/> Aſſurance of a mans Happineſs and Bleſſedneſs. And as he ſaid, If there be any way to Heaven on horſe-back, it is by Prayer: So I ſay, If there be any way in the world to aſſurance, it is by being fearful to offend, and careful to pleaſe the Spirit of the Lord; whoſe office it is, to witneſs to poor ſouls, the remiſſion of their ſins, and the ſalvation of their ſouls.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, If you would obtain Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance,<note place="margin">Means 4.</note> then be ſincere, be diligent and conſtant in aſſuring Ordinances: He that will meet the King, muſt wait<note place="margin">Iſai. 64. 5. Revel. 2. 1.</note> on him in his walks; Chriſts Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, are Chriſts walks; and he that would ſee the beauty of Chriſt, and taſte of the ſweetneſs of Chriſt, and be raviſhed with the love of Chriſt, muſt wait at Wiſdoms door, they<note place="margin">Prov. 8. 34, 35.</note> muſt attend Chriſt in his own appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and inſtitutions, that comfort and aſſurance that flowes not in tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the Golden Pipes of the Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary,<note place="margin">Hoſ. 6. 4. 1 Pet. 1. 24.</note> will not better the ſoul, nor long abide with the ſoul, it will be as the morning dew, and as the flower of the field that ſoon fadeth away. I have
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:169968:167"/> in the former Diſcourſe, ſhewed at large, How the Lord is graciouſly pleaſed to cauſe his love and glory, to beam forth upon ſouls in Ordinances; and therefore, I ſhall ſay no more unto this particular at this time.</p>
               <p>The fifth Means to obtain Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,<note place="margin">Means 5.</note> is, wiſely and ſeriouſly to obſerve, What gift of God there is in thee that brings thee within the compaſs of the promiſes of eternal mercy? Now let the gift, be this or that, if it be a gift that brings thee within the compaſs of the promiſe of Eternal Mercy? that gift is an infallible evidence of thy Salvation: For the better and further opening of this Truth, premiſe with me theſe two things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, No man can have any ſure evidence to himſelf of his Happineſs and Bleſſedneſs, from abſolute pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes: Abſolute promiſes do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe to whom Salvation, and all E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal<note place="margin">Iſai 42. 6. &amp; 49. 8. Joel 2. 28. Ezek. 36. 26, 27. Jere. 32. 40. Heb. 8, 10, 11, 12. Iſai. 23. 25.</note> Bleſſings, do belong; the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of giving Chriſt, of giving the Spirit, of giving a new heart, and of pardoning and blotting out ſin, are all abſolute promiſes. Now God is free
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:169968:168"/> to make good theſe to whom he pleaſes; therefore he often ſteps over the rich, and chuſes the poor; the learned, and chuſes the ignorant; the<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 25, 26, 27, 28, 29.</note> ſtrong, and chuſes the weak; the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and chuſes the ignoble; the ſweet nature, and chuſes the rugged nature, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That no fleſh may glory, and that all may ſhout out Grace, Grace.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Though no man can have any ſure evidence of his Happineſs and Bleſſedneſs from abſolute pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, becauſe abſolute promiſes do not deſcribe the perſons to whom Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and all Eternal Bleſſings, do belong; yet abſolute promiſes are of moſt choice and ſingular uſe: Firſt, In that they diſcover to us, that our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is onely from Free-grace, and not from any thing in us, or done by us. Secondly, They are a moſt ſure and glorious foundation, for the very worſt of ſinners to ſtay their filthy, guilty, wearied, burdened, perplexed ſouls upon; ſeeing, that God looks not for any peny or peniworth, for<note place="margin">Iſai. 55. 1, 2.</note> any portion, or proportion in the Creature to draw his love; but he will
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:169968:168"/> juſtifie, pardon, and ſave, for his Name ſake; ſeeing all the Motives that moves God to ſhew mercy, are in his<note place="margin">Deut. 7. 7, 8.

               <p>Theſe things being premiſed, ſee now what gift of God there is in thee, that brings thee within the compaſs of the promiſe of Everlaſting Happineſs and Bleſſedneſs; and to help you a little
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:169968:169"/> in this, I ſhall put you in minde of theſe following particulars.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Faith is a gift of God that brings the ſoul within the promiſe of Everlaſting Bleſſedneſs, as the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture doth every where evidence, <hi>He</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mark. 16. 16. John 3. 15, 16, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>that believes ſhall be ſaved;</hi> he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves, ſhall not come into condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he ſhall not periſh, he ſhall have eternal life, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now believing is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, but the accepting of Chriſt<note place="margin">John 1. 12. vide.</note> for thy Lord and Saviour, as he is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to thee in the Goſpel; and this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting is principally (if not onely) the act of thy will; ſo that if thou art ſincerely and cordially willing to have Chriſt upon his own terms, upon Goſpel terms, that is, to ſave thee, and rule thee, to redeem thee, and to reign over thee, then thou art a Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, thy ſincere willingneſs to believe, is thy Faith; and this gift brings thee within the compaſs of the promiſe of Eternal Happineſs, and Bleſſedneſs. Chriſtian Reader, in the following Diſcourſe thou wilt finde the nature, the properties, and the excellencies of a found ſaving Faith, clearly and large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly laid open before thee; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:169968:169"/> I ſhall ſay no more to it in this place, but refer thee to what follows.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Waiting patiently on God, is a gift that brings thee with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the promiſe of Everlaſting Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Bleſſedneſs. And he that hath but a waiting frame of heart, hath that, that God will eternally own and crown. <hi>Iſa. 30. 18. And therefore will the Lord wait, that he may be gracious unto you; and therefore will he be exalted, that he may have mercy upon you; for the Lord is a God of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Bleſſed are all they that wait for him.</hi> Verily, it is no iniquity to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce them bleſſed, that God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces bleſſed; it is no piety, but cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty and inhumanity, for any not to be as merciful to themſelves, as God is merciful to them; not to have as ſweet and precious thoughts of their preſent condition, as God hath. If God ſayes the waiting ſoul is bleſſed, who dares judge, who dares ſay, it is not bleſſed? <hi>Let God be true, and every man a lyer.</hi> Iſa. 64. 4. <hi>For ſince the beginning of the world, men have not heard, nor perceived by the ear, neither hath the eye ſeen, O God, beſides thee, what he hath prepared for him
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:169968:170"/> that waiteth for him.</hi> Prov. 8. 34. <hi>Bleſſed is the man that heareth me; watching daily at my gates, waiting at the poſts of my doors.</hi> Iſai. 49. 23. <hi>They ſhall not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed that wait for me:</hi> That is, I will never fail the waiting ſoul, I will never put him to bluſhing, by fruſtrating his patient waiting on me. The waiting ſoul ſhall bear the Bell, and carry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Crown at laſt. Verily, glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous love and power, is as much ſeen in keeping up a poor ſoul, in a patient waiting on God, as it was in raiſing Chriſt from the Grave, and as it is in bringing ſouls to glory. Nothing can make the waiting ſoul miſerable. Hold out Faith and patience, <hi>but a little, and</hi>

                  <hi>he that ſhall come, will come, and bring his reward with him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, Hungering and thirſting after Righteouſneſs, is a gift that brings the ſoul within the compaſs of the promiſe of Everlaſting Happineſs and Bleſſedneſs. <hi>Matth. 5. 6. Bleſſed are they which do hunger and thirſt after Righteouſneſs; for they ſhall be filled,</hi> or<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>.</note> as it runs in the Greek, <hi>Bleſſed are they that are hungring and thirſting.</hi> Inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating, that where ever this is the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:169968:170"/> diſpoſition of mens ſouls, they are bleſſed, and may expect ſpiritual repletions. Conſiderable to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe is that of <hi>Iſai. 44. 2, 3, 4, 5. Thus ſaith the Lord that made thee, and formed thee from the Womb, which will help thee: Fear not, O</hi> Jacob <hi>my ſervant, and thou</hi> Jeſurun, <hi>whom I have choſen. For I will pour water upon him that is thirſty,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">By <hi>Water</hi> is meant <hi>the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> ſay ſome; others under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it of the Spiritual Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Grace, That God will power out up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe that thirſt, and long after an abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Grace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>and flouds upon the dry ground: I will pour my Spirit upon thy Seed, and my Bleſsing upon thy Off-ſpring: And they ſhall ſpring up as among the graſs, as Willows by the Water-courſes. One ſhall ſay, I am the Lords; and another ſhall call himſelf by the name of</hi> Jacob; <hi>and another ſhall ſubſcribe with his hand unto the Lord, and ſirname himſelf by the name of</hi> Iſrael. Of the like conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is that of <hi>Iſa. 35. 6, 7. Then ſhall the lame man leap as a Hart, and the tongue of the dumb ſing; for in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs ſhall waters break forth, and ſtreams in the deſert. And the parched ground ſhall become a Pool, and the thirſty Land ſprings of Water: In the habitation of Dragons, where each lay, ſhall be Groſs, with Reeds and Ruſhes.</hi> To the like pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe is that in <hi>Pſal. 107. 9. For he
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:169968:171"/> ſatisfieth the longing ſoul; and filleth the hungry ſoul with goodneſs.</hi> But that none may miſtake, nor miſcarry in this buſineſs, that is of an eternal concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to them; I ſhall deſire them to premiſe with me theſe following things, for a better and fuller clearing of this particular truth that is under our preſent conſideration.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Premiſe this with me. All real hungerings and thirſtings after Righteouſneſs, are earneſt and vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thirſtings and longings, they are like <hi>Rachels</hi> longing for children, and like <hi>Samſons</hi> longing for water. <hi>Pſal. 42. 1, 2. As the Hart panteth after the water-brooks, ſo panteth my ſoul after thee, O God: My ſoul thirſteth for God, for the living God, when ſhall I come and appear before God?</hi> Philoſophers ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, That of all Beaſts the Hart is moſt thirſty by nature, but moſt of all thirſty, when ſhe is hunted and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued by Dogs: Sayes <hi>David,</hi> As the hunted Hart, as the wounded Hart, yea, as the She-hart, in whom the paſſions of thirſt are ſtrongeſt, panteth after the water-brooks; ſo doth my ſoul pant after thee, O God. A graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:169968:171"/> ſoul panteth and fainteth, it<note place="margin">Pſal. 119. 20.</note> breatheth and breaketh for the long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it hath at all times, after the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Chriſt, imputed and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuled. The Greeks derive their word for deſire, from a Root that ſignifies <hi>to burn.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ah Chriſtians, real deſires, are burning deſires, they ſet the ſoul all in a holy flame after God and Chriſt; if they are not vehement, if they do not put an edge upon thy affections, if they do not make thee like a burning Seraphim. Chriſt will take no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in them, they ſhall return into thy own boſom without working any wonders in Heaven, as thoſe deſires do that flow from the ſouls, being <hi>touched with a coal from the Altar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Premiſe this with me,<note place="margin">Pſal. 63. 1, 2, 3, 4 &amp; 27 4. Cant. 1. 2. Phil 3 7, 8, 9; 10.</note> All real longings and hungerings in the ſoul after Righteouſneſs, ariſes from Spiritual and Heavenly Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations; they ſpring in the ſoul from ſome convictions, ſome apprehenſions, ſome perſwaſions, that the ſoul hath of a real worth, of a real beauty, glory, and excellency that is in Chriſt, and in his Righteouſneſs, imputed and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="290" facs="tcp:169968:172"/> Such deſires after Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that flow from external conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, are of no worth, weight, or continuance; but thoſe deſires after Righteouſneſs, that flow from Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual conſiderations, are full of ſpirit, life, and glory; they are ſuch that<note place="margin">Pſal. 145. 19.</note> God will not onely obſerve, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept; not onely record, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Real hungerings and thirſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings after Chriſt and his Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> will put the ſoul upon live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly endeavors: If they are true born deſires, they will not make the ſoul idle but active, not negligent but di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent in the uſe of all holy means, whereby the ſoul may enjoy Chriſt and his Righteouſneſs. <hi>Iſa. 26. 9.

Even ſo, all holy deſires will put ſouls upon the uſe of the means, whereby the mercy deſired may be gained. And thus to run, is to attain; thus to will, is to work; thus to deſire, is to do the will of our Father, who accepts of pence for pounds, of mites for millions. The <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarch was not ſo famous for accepting a little water from the hand of a loving Subject, as our God is, for accepting of a handful of Meal,<note place="margin">Levit 2. 2.

Such is Gods condiſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing love to weak worms, that he looks more at their will, then at their work; he mindes more what they would do, then what they do do; he always pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer

               <p>Fourthly, Spiritual hungerings and thirſtings, are onely ſatisfied with Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual things. <hi>John 14. 8. Shew us the Father, and it ſuffic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The lives of men convince more ſtrongly, then their words; the tongue perſwades, but the life commands; thirdly, They know by living up to their principles, they caſt a general glory upon Chriſt and<note place="margin">Matth. 5. 16. 1 Pet. 2. 11, 12.</note> his ways: This makes Chriſt and his ways to be well thought on, and well ſpoke on; fourthly, They know that the ready way, the onely way to get<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1, 5. to 13.</note> and keep Aſſurance, Joy, Peace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is to live up to their principles; fifth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, They know that by their living below their own principles, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to their own principles, they do but gratifie Satan, and provoke wicked men to blaſpheme that worthy Name,

Yes, we do theſe things, we ſhould belie the grace of God, if we ſhould ſay otherwiſe, theſe things the Lord hath wrought in us, and for<note place="margin">Iſa. 26. 12.</note> us. Well then, know firſt, that your eſtate is good, you have certainly a bleſſed intereſt in the Lord Jeſus.

Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Know, that it is no iniquity, but rather your duty for you to ſuck ſweetneſſe out of theſe hony-combs, and to look upon theſe things as infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible pledges, and evidences of divine favor, and of your everlaſting happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and bleſſedneſſe. Some there be that make the witneſſe of the Spirit (of which I ſhall towards the cloſe of this Diſcourſe ſpeake at large) the only evidence of our intereſt in Chriſt, and deny all other evidences from the fruit of the Spirit; but this is to deny the fruit growing upon the tree, to be an evedience that the tree is alive; whereas all know, that the fruit grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the tree, is an infallible and

Certainly it is one thing to judge by our Graces, and another thing to reſt upon our Graces, or to put truſt in our Graces: When one argues from the beames of the Sun, that there is a Sun, one would thinke that the moſt cavilling ſpirit in the world ſhould lye quiet and ſtill.</p>

               <p>Sixthly, Prayer is another of thoſe ſweet things that accompanies ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Rom. 10. 10. 13. <hi>For with the heart man beleeveth unto righteouſneſſe, and with the mouth confeſsion is made unto ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.

Praying ſouls ſhall finde the gates of heaven open to them, when prophecying ſouls ſhall find them ſhut againſt them.</p>
               <p>Seventhly and laſtly, Perſeverance is another of thoſe prime things that accompanies ſalvation, Matth. 10. 22. <hi>And yee ſhall be hated of all men for my name ſake: but he that indureth to the end the ſame ſhall be ſaved.</hi> Chap. 24. 12, 13.

God who commanded the light to ſhine out of darkneſſe, hath ſhined in our hearts, to give us the light of the knowledge of the glory of God, in the face of Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> Divine light reaches the heart as well as the head. The beames of Divine light ſhining in upon the ſoule thorow the glorious face of Chriſt, are very working; they warm the heart, they
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:169968:191"/> affect the heart, they new mould the heart. Divine knowledge maſters the heart, it guides the heart, it governs the heart, it ſuſtains the heart, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves the heart. <hi>Rom. 6. 6. We know that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of ſin might be deſtroyed, that hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth</hi>

                  <hi>we ſhould not ſerve ſin.</hi> Divine knowledge puts a man upon crucifying of ſin, it keeps a man from being a ſervant, a ſlave to ſin, which no other knowledge can do. Under all other knowledge, men remain ſervants to their luſts, and are taken priſoners by Satan at his will. No knowledge lifts a man up above his luſts, but that which accompanies ſalvation. The wiſeſt Philoſophers, and the greateſt<note place="margin">As <hi>Socrates</hi> and others.</note> Doctors, under all their ſublime no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and rare ſpeculations, have been kept in bondage by their luſts. That knowledge that accompanies ſalvation, is operative knowledge. 1 <hi>John 2. 3, 4. And hereby we do know, that we know him, if we keep his Commandments. He that ſaith I know him, and keepeth not his Commandments, is a lier, and the</hi>

                  <hi>truth is not in him.</hi> By keeping his Commandments they did know, that
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:169968:191"/> they did know him; that is, they were aſſured that they did know him. To know that we know, is to be aſſured that we know. So in <hi>Jam. 3. 17. But the wiſdom that is from above, is firſt pure, then peaceable, gentle, and eaſie to be intreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; full of mercy, and good fruits; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out partiality, and without hypocriſie.</hi> Verſe 13. <hi>Who is a wiſe man, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with knowledge amongſt you? Let him ſhew out of a good converſation, his works with meekneſs of wiſdom.</hi> Divine knowledge fills a man full of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual activity, it will make a man work, as if he would be ſaved by his works; and yet it will make a man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that he is ſaved onely upon the<note place="margin">Epheſ. 2. 8.</note> account of Free-grace.

               <p>Secondly, That Knowledge that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companies Salvation, is transforming knowledge, it is metamorphoſing knowledge, it is knowledge that trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms, that metamorphoſies the ſoul. 2 <hi>Cor. 3. 18.

<pb n="331" facs="tcp:169968:192"/> Jeſus, and reſemble him to the life. Notional knowledge may make a man excellent at praiſing the glorious and worthy acts and vertues of Chriſt; but that transforming knowledge that accompanies ſalvation, will work a man divinely to imitate the glorious acts and vertues of Chriſt. 1 <hi>Pet. 2. 9. But ye are a choſen Generation, a royal Prieſthood, an holy Nation, a peculiar People, that ye ſhould ſhew forth the praiſes of him</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>) preach forth the vertues of Chriſt in an imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table practiſe; and till then a man under all other knowledge, will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main an incarnate Devil. When a beam of Divine Light ſhined from Heaven upon <hi>Paul,</hi> Ah how did it<note place="margin">Acts 9. 3, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Divine light layes upon a man, <hi>Felix ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitas,</hi> a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py neceſſity of obeying God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> change and metomorphiſe him? how did it alter and transform him? it made his rebellious ſoul obedient? <hi>Acts 9. 6. Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?</hi> God bids him ariſe and go into the City, and it ſhould be told him
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:169968:193"/> what he ſhould do; and he obeyes the Heavenly viſion. <hi>Chap.</hi> 26. 19. Divine light makes this Lion a Lamb, this Perſecutor a Preacher, this Deſtroyer of the Saints, a Builder up of the Saints, this Tormentor a Comforter, this Monſter an Angel, this Notorious Blaſphemer, a very great admirer of God, and the actings of his Free-grace, as you may ſee by comparing the nineth, and twenty ſixt Chapters of the <hi>Acts</hi> together. So when a ſpark of this Heavenly fire fell upon the heart of <hi>Mary Magdalen, Luke</hi> 7. O what a change, what a turn doth it make in her; now ſhe loves much, and believes much, and repents much, and weeps much. O what a change did Divine light make in <hi>Zacheus,</hi> and in the Jailor. Verily, if thy light, thy knowledge doth not better thee? if it doth not change and transform thee? if under all thy light and knowledge thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineſt as vile and baſe as ever? thy light, thy knowledge, thy notions, thy ſpeculations, will be like to fire not on the Hearth, but in the Room, that will burn the Houſe, and the Inhabitant too; it will be like mettle in a blinde
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:169968:193"/> horſe, that ſerves for nothing but to break the neck of the rider. That knowledge that is not a transforming knowledge, will torment a man at laſt more then all the Devils in Hell; it will be a Sword to cut him, a Rod to laſh him, a Serpent to bite him, a Scorpion to ſting him, and a Vulture, a Worm eternally gnawing him. When <hi>Tamberlain</hi> was in his wars, one having found and digged up a great pot of Gold, brought it to him, <hi>Tamberlain</hi> asked whether it had his Fathers ſtamp upon it; but when he ſaw it had the <hi>Roman</hi> ſtamp, and not his Fathers, he would not own it. So God at laſt will own no knowledge, but that which leaves the ſtamp of Chriſt, the print of Chriſt, the image of Chriſt upon the heart. But that which changes and transforms the ſoul, that makes a man a new man, another man, then what he was before Divine light ſhined upon him.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That Knowledge that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companies ſalvation, is experimental Knowledge; it is knowledge that ſprings from a ſpiritual ſenſe and taſte of holy and heavenly things. <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.

               <p>Fourthly, that <hi>Knowledge</hi> that accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies ſalvation is a heart-affecting-know<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ledge; it affects the heart with Chriſt and all ſpiritual things.

O the hearing of Chriſt affects me, the ſeeing of Chriſt affects me, the taſte of Chriſt affects mee,
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:169968:197"/> the glimmerings of Chriſt affects me; the more I come to know him in his Natures, in his Names, in his Offices, in his diſcoveries, in his appearances, in his beauties, the more I finde my heart and affections to prize Chriſt, to<note place="margin">Pſal 73. 23, 25, 26.</note> run after Chriſt, to be affected with Chriſt, and to be wonderfully indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to Chriſt, <hi>Cant. 5. 10. He is white and ruddy the cheifeſt of ten thouſand:</hi> The knowledge that ſhe had of Chriſt did ſo affect and indear her heart to Chriſt that ſhe cannot but make uſe of all her Rhetorick to ſet forth Chriſt in the moſt lovely and lively colours. <hi>Gal. 6. 14. God forbid that I ſhould glory in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing, ſave in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> O God forbid that my heart ſhould be affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or taken with any thing in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of Chriſt: The more I know him, the more I like him; the more I know him, the more I love him; the more I know him, the more I deſire him; the more I know him, the more my heart is knit unto him His Beauty is taking, his Love is raviſhing, his Goodneſſe is drawing, his Manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are inticing, and his Perſon is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amoring. His lovely Looks pleaſes me,
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:169968:198"/> his pleaſant Voice delights mee, his precious Spirit comforts me, his holy Word rules mee; and theſe things make Chriſt to be a Heaven unto me. O but now, all that notionall know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that ſpeculative knowledge, that leaves a man on this ſide ſalvation; never affects the heart, it never draws it, it never indears the heart to Chriſt, or to the precious things of Chriſt. Hence it is, that ſuch men under all their notions, under all their light and knowledge, have no affection to Chriſt, no delight in Chriſt, no workings of heart after Chriſt. Well Reader, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member this, if thy knowledge doth not now affect thy heart, it will at laſt with a witneſſe afflict thy heart; if it doth not now indear Chriſt to thee, it will at laſt the more provoke Chriſt againſt thee; if it doth not make all the things of Chriſt to be very preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in thy eyes, it will at laſt make thee the more vile in Chriſts eyes. A little knowledge that divinely af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects the heart, is infinitely better then a world of that ſwimming knowledge that ſwims in the head, but never ſinks down into the heart, to the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:169968:198"/> to the warming, and to the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting of it. Therefore ſtrive not ſo much to know, as to have thy heart affected with what thou knoweſt. For heart-affecting knowledge is the onely knowledge that accompanies ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that will poſſeſs thee of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

<pb n="346" facs="tcp:169968:200"/> parts with it, he ſets very light by it he looks with an eye of diſdain upon it: His knowledge lifts him up above the ſmiles of the world, and above the frowns of the world; the world is no longer a ſnare, a bait, a temptation to him; he knows that it is more to be a ſon of <hi>Abraham</hi> (that is, to be taken into covenant with <hi>Abraham,</hi> to<note place="margin">Rom 4. 12, 16. &amp; 9 1.</note> tread in the ſteps of <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith, as children tread in the ſteps of their fathers, and to lie and reſt in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom of <hi>Abraham,</hi> as ſons do in their fathers boſoms,) then to be rich, great, and honorable in the world.

If thy know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge doth not inable thee to ſet thy feet upon thoſe things that moſt ſet their hearts? thou art undone for ever, thy knowledge will be ſo far from lifting thee up to Heaven, that it will caſt thee the lower into Hell.

Chriſt wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully extols <hi>John:</hi> Sayes Chriſt, he is a Prophet, yea, and more then a Prophet, yea, a greater is not born of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men: But the greateſt won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of all is, that <hi>John</hi> is ſo low in his own eyes.</note> moſt Eagle-eyed, he had the cleareſt ſight of Chriſt, he lay moſt in the boſom of Chriſt, he knew moſt of the minde of Chriſt, he had the fulleſt manifeſtations, and revelations of Chriſt; and yet, O how little, how low is <hi>John</hi> in his own eyes. <hi>John</hi> 1. 26, 27. John <hi>anſwered them, ſaying, I baptize with water, but there ſtandeth one among you, whom ye know not: He it is, who coming after me, is preferred before me, whoſe ſhooes latchet I am not worthy to unlooſe.</hi> In this phraſe, <hi>John</hi> alludes to the cuſtom of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> thoſe among them which were more noble then others, had

O, ſayes <hi>John,</hi> I am a poor weak, worthleſs Creature, I am not worthy to be admitted to the meaneſt, to the loweſt ſervice under Chriſt, I am not worthy to carry his ſhooes, to unlooſe his ſhooes. After <hi>Peter</hi> had been in the Mount, and inſtructed and enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by Chriſt, he cryes out, <hi>Depart from me, O Lord, for I am a ſinful man.</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">

Again, Faith ſpreads the promiſes of Divine aſſiſtance before the ſoul; O ſayes Faith, here O ſoul, is aſſiſtance ſuitable to the work required: And this makes a man work, as for life; it makes a man work and ſweat, and ſweat and work. Again, Faith ſets the Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence,

                  </note> ſayes Faith, Look here ſoul, here is a great reward, for a little work; here is great wages, for weak and imperfect ſervices; here is an infinite reward, for a finite work. Work, yea, work hard, ſayes Faith, O believing ſoul, for thy actions in paſſing, paſs not away; every good work is a grain of Seed for eternal life. There is a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection<note place="margin">Rev. 14. 13.</note> of works, as well as of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and in that day, wicked men ſhall ſee, that it is not a vain thing to ſerve God; they ſhall ſee the moſt doing ſouls, to be the moſt ſhining ſouls, to be moſt advanced and rewarded. O the ſight of this Crown, of this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence, makes ſouls to abound in the work of the Lord, they knowing<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. ult.</note> that their labor is not in vain in the Lord. Again, Faith draws from Chriſts fulneſs, it ſucks vertue and ſtrength<note place="margin">John 1. 16.</note> from Chriſts breſts: Faith looks upon Chriſt as a Head, and ſo draws from him; it looks upon Chriſt as a Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and ſo draws from him; it looks upon him as a Fountain, and ſo draws from him; it looks upon him as a Sea, as an Ocean of goodneſs, and<note place="margin">Col. 1. 19.</note>
                  <pb n="380" facs="tcp:169968:217"/> ſo draws from him; it looks upon him as a Father, and ſo draws from him; it looks upon him as a Friend, and ſo draws from him; and this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine power and ſtrength, ſets the ſoul a working hard for God, it makes the ſoul full of motion, full of action. In a word, Faith is ſuch a working Grace, as ſets all other graces a work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Faith hath an influence upon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Grace, it is like a ſilver thred that runs thorow a chain of Pearl, it puts ſtrength and vivacity into all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vertues. Love touched by a hand of Faith, flames forth; hope fed at Faiths table, grows ſtrong, and caſts anckor within the vail. Joy, courage,<note place="margin">Acts 5. &amp; 16. Rom. 15. 13.</note> and zeal, being ſmiled upon by Faith, is made invincible, and unconquerable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>And thus you ſee, that that Faith that accompanies Salvation, is a work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faith, a lively faith, and not ſuch a dead faith, as moſt pleaſe, and deceive themſelves with, for ever.</p>
               <pb n="381" facs="tcp:169968:217"/>
               <p>The ſecond Property of that Faith that accompanies Salvation, is this, It is of a growing and increaſing na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; it is like the waters of the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary, that riſe higher and higher, as <hi>Ezekiel</hi> ſpeaks; it is like a tender Plant that naturally grows higher and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;<note place="margin">Matth. 13. 32. <hi>The righteous ſhall flouriſh like the Palm tree.</hi> Pſal. 92. 12, 13, 14.

                  </note> it is like a grain of Muſtard-ſeed, which though it be the leaſt of all Seeds, yet by a Divine power it grows up beyond all humane expectations. Faith is imperfect, as all other graces are, but yet it grows and increaſes gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually. <hi>Rom. 1. 17. For therein is the righteouſneſs of God revealed, from Faith to faith: As it is written, The juſt ſhall live by Faith.</hi> As a gracious ſoul is ſtill a adding knowledge to knowledge, love to love, fear to fear, zeal to zeal; ſo he is a adding faith to faith. A gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſoul knows, That if he be rich in Faith, he cannot be poor in other Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; he knows the growth of faith, will be as the former and the latter rain, to all other graces; he knows that there is no way to out-grow his fears, but by growing in Faith; he knows that all the pleaſant fruits of paradiſe, <hi>viz.</hi> Joy, comfort, and
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:169968:218"/> peace, flouriſhes as faith flouriſhes; he knows that he hath much work<note place="margin">An old man being once asked, If he grew in grace, anſwered, <hi>Yea, doubtleſs I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve I do, for God hath ſaid in his Word, that we ſhall flouriſh and bring forth fruit in old age.

<pb n="383" facs="tcp:169968:218"/> honors, a growth in riches, a growth in notions, a growth in opinions. That Faith that accompanies Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,<note place="margin">The union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Chriſt and the Saints, is the neareſt and the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt union; and ſo it advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages their graces, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances them to a higher de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, then any other Creatures whatſoever.

                     </gap> eſſentially, nor perſonal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yet really and ſpiritually.</note> unites the ſoul to Chriſt, and keeps the ſoul up in communion with Chriſt. And from that union and communion that the ſoul hath with Chriſt, flows ſuch a Divine power, and vertue, that cauſes Faith to grow: Yet that no weak Believers may be ſtumbled, or ſadded, Let them remember, Firſt, That though that Faith that accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies Salvation, be a growing faith; yet there are ſome certain ſeaſons, and caſes, wherein a man may decay in his faith, and wherein he may not have the exerciſe, and the actings of his faith. This bleſſed Babe of Grace may be caſt into a deep ſlumber; this Heavenly Pearl may be ſo buried un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the thick clay of this world, and under the aſhes of corruption and temptation, as that for a time, it may neither ſtir, nor grow, as might be ſhewn in <hi>Abraham, David, Solomon, Peter,</hi> and others. Secondly, Remem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ber this, That the ſtrongeſt faith at times, is ſubject to ſhakings, as the ſtrongeſt men are to faintings, as the
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:169968:219"/> ſtouteſt ſhips are to toſſings, as the wiſeſt men are to doubtings, as the brighteſt ſtars are to twinklings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Therefore if at certain times, thou ſhouldſt not be ſenſible of the growth of thy faith, yet do not conclude, that thou haſt no faith: Faith may be in the habit, when it is not in the act; there may be life in the root of the Tree, when there is neither leaves, bloſſoms, nor fruit upon the Tree; the life that is in the root<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> will ſhew it ſelf at the Spring, and ſo will the habits of Faith break forth into acts, when the Sun of Righteouſneſs ſhall ſhine forth, and make it a pleaſant ſpring to thy ſoul. And thus much for this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond particular.</p>
               <p>The third Property of that Faith that accompanies Salvation, is this, It makes thoſe things that are great and glorious in the worlds account, to be very little and low in the eyes of a Believer. Faith makes a Believer to<note place="margin">Heb. 11. 9.</note> live in the Land of Promiſe, as in a ſtrange Country; it is nothing to live as a ſtranger in a ſtrange Land, but to live as a ſtranger in the Land of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, this is the excellency and glory
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:169968:219"/> of Faith. Faith will make a man ſet his feet, where other men ſets their hearts. Faith looks with an eye of ſcorn and diſdain, upon the things of this world: What, ſayes Faith, are earthly treaſures, to the treaſures of<note place="margin">Matth 6. 19, 20.</note> Heaven? what are ſtones to ſilver, droſs to gold, darkneſs to light, Hell to Heaven? No more, ſayes Faith, are all the treaſures, pleaſures, and delights of this world, to the light of<note place="margin">Pſal. 4. 6, 7.</note> thy countenance, to the joy of thy ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, to the influences of thy grace. I ſee nothing, ſayes <hi>David,</hi> in this wide world, onely <hi>thy Commandments are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 11. 24, 25, 26.</note> 
                  <hi>broad.</hi> Faith makes <hi>David</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count his Crown nothing, his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures nothing, his victories nothing, his attendants nothing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Faith will make a man write nothing upon the beſt of worldly things; it will make a man trample upon the Pearls of this<note place="margin">Phil. 3. 8.</note> world, as upon droſs and dung. Faith deadens a mans heart, to the things of this world, <hi>I am crucified to the world,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gal. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>and the world is crucified to me,</hi> ſayes <hi>Paul.</hi> This world, ſayes Faith, is not my houſe, my habitation, my home, I<note place="margin">2 Cor 5. 1, 2.</note> look for a better Country, for a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:169968:220"/> City, for a better home. He that is adopted Heir to a Crown, a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, looks with an eye of ſcorn, and diſdain, upon every thing below a Kingdom, below a Crown. Faith tells the ſoul, that it hath a Crown, a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom<note place="margin">2 Tim 4. 8.</note> in reverſion; and this makes the ſoul to ſet light by the things of this world. Faith raiſes and ſets the ſoul high; <hi>And hath raiſed us up together,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Epheſ. 2. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>and made us ſit together in heavenly places in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle. Faith makes a man live high, our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation<note place="margin">Phil. 3. 20.</note> is in Heaven; and the higher any man lives, the leſs, the lower will the things of this world be in his eye. The fancy of <hi>Lucian</hi> is very pleaſant, who placeth <hi>Charon</hi> on the top of an high Hill, viewing all the affairs of men, and looking on their greateſt, richeſt, and moſt glorious Cities, as little Birds Neſts. Faith ſets the ſoul upon the Hill of God, the Mountain of God, that is, A high Mountain; and from thence, Faith gives the ſoul a ſight, a proſpect of all things here below. And, ah how like Birds Neſts does all the riches, braveries, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of this world look, and appear to
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:169968:220"/> them, that Faith hath ſet upon Gods high Hill. Faith having ſet <hi>Luther</hi> upon this high Hill, he proteſts, that God ſhould not put him off with theſe poor, low things. Faith ſet <hi>Moſes</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 11.</note> high, it ſet him among inviſibles, and that made him look upon all the treaſures, pleaſures, riches, and glories of <hi>Egypt,</hi> as little Birds-Neſts, as Mole-hills, as droſs and dung; as things that were too little, and too low for him to ſet his heart upon. Verily, when once Faith hath given a man a ſight, a proſpect of Heaven, all things on Earth will be looked upon, as little and low. And ſo much for this third Property of Faith.</p>
               <p>The fourth Property of that Faith that accompanies Salvation, is this, It purifies the heart, it is a heart-purify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note place="margin">Acts 15. 9.</note> faith: Purifying their hearts by faith. Faith hath two hands, one to lay hold on Chriſt, and another to ſweep the heart, which is Chriſts houſe. Faith knows that Chriſt is of a Dove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like nature, he loves to lie clean, and ſweet; Faith hath a neat Huſwifes hand, as well as an Eagles eye; Faith is as good at purging out of ſin, as it
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:169968:221"/> is at diſcovering of ſin. There is a cleanſing quality in Faith, as well as a healing quality in Faith. Sound faith will purge the ſoul from the love of ſin, from a delight in ſin, and from the<note place="margin">Ezek. 16.</note> reign and dominion of ſin. <hi>Sin ſhall not have dominion over you; for ye are</hi>

Faith
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:169968:221"/> makes the ſoul divinely impudent, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely ſhameleſs. Lord, ſayes Faith, are not theſe thine own words; haſt thou ſaid it, and ſhall it not come to paſs? art thou no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> a faithful God? is not thine honor engaged to make good the promiſes that thou haſt made? A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe, O God, and let my ſins be ſcatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; turn thy hand upon me, and let my ſins be purged. And thus Faith purifies the heart. Again, ſometimes Faith purifies the heart from ſin, by engaging againſt ſin in Chriſts ſtrength, as <hi>David</hi> engaged againſt <hi>Goliah,</hi> not in<note place="margin">1 Sam. 17. 45.</note> his own ſtrength, but in the ſtrength and name of the Lord of Hoſts. Faith leads the ſoul directly to God, and engages God againſt ſin; ſo as that the combate, by the wiſdom of Faith, is changed and made now rather between God and ſin, then between ſin and the ſoul; and ſo ſin comes to fall before the power, and glorious preſence of God; that is a choice word. <hi>Pſal. 61. 2. From the ends of the earth, will I cry to thee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> When my heart is over-whelmed, lead me to the Rock that is higher then I.</hi> Look as a childe that is ſet upon by one that is ſtronger then he, cryes out
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:169968:222"/> to his Father, to help him, to ſtand by him, and to engage for him againſt his enemy; ſo Faith being ſenſible of its own weakneſs and inability, to get the victory over ſin, cries out to Chriſt, and engages Chriſt, who is ſtronger then the ſtrong man; and ſo Chriſt binds the ſtrong man, and caſts him out. Faith tells the ſoul, That all purpoſes, reſolutions, and endeavors, without Chriſt be engaged, will never ſet the ſoul above its ſins; they will never purifie the heart from ſin. Therefore Faith engages Chriſt, and caſts the main of the work upon Chriſt, and ſo it purges the ſoul from ſin. <hi>Luther</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of <hi>Staupicius,</hi> a <hi>German</hi> Divine, that he acknowledged, that before he came to underſtand the free and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful grace of Chriſt, that he vowed and reſolved an hundred times againſt ſome particular ſin, and could never get power over it; he could never get his heart purified from it, till he came to ſee that he truſted too much to his own reſolutions, and too little to Jeſus Chriſt: But when his faith had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged Chriſt againſt his ſin, he had the victory. Again, Faith purifies the
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:169968:222"/> heart from ſin; by the application of Chriſts Blood. Faith makes a plaiſter<note place="margin">It is the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of Faith, that it can turn the Blood of Chriſt, both into food and into Phyſick.</note> of Chriſts bleſſed Blood, and layes it on upon the ſouls ſoars, and ſo cures it. Faith makes a heavenly vomit of this bleſſed Blood, and gives it to the ſoul, and ſo makes it caſt up that poyſon that it hath drunk in. Faith tells the ſoul, that it is not all the tears in the world, nor all the water in the Sea, that can waſh away the uncleanneſs of the ſoul; it is onely the Blood of Chriſt that can make a Blackmoor white; it is onely the Blood of Chriſt that can cure a Leprous <hi>Naaman,</hi> that can cure a Leprous ſoul. This Fountain of Blood, ſayes Faith, is the onely Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain for <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to waſh<note place="margin">Zach 13. 1.</note> themſelves, to waſh their hearts from all uncleanneſs, and filthineſs of fleſh and ſpirit. Thoſe ſpots a Chriſtian findes in his own heart, can onely be waſhed out in the Blood of the Lamb by a hand of Faith. Again, Faith pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifieth the ſoul from ſin, by putting the ſoul upon heart-purifying Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and by mixing and mingling it ſelf with Ordinances. <hi>The word profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 4 2.</note> 
                  <hi>them not</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>becauſe
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:169968:223"/> it was not mixt with faith in them that heard it.</hi> Faith is ſuch an excellent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredient, that it makes all potions work for the good of the ſoul, for the purifying of the ſoul, and for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering of the ſoul, and no potion, no means will profit the ſoul, if this heavenly ingredient be not mixt with it. Now Faith puts a man upon pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, upon hearing, upon the fellowſhip of the Saints, upon publick duties, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on family duties, and upon Cloſet du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and Faith in theſe, comes and joyns with the ſoul, and mixes her ſelf<note place="margin">As Chriſt came and joyn'd himſelf to his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</note> with theſe ſoul-purifying Ordinances, and ſo makes them effectual for the purifying of the ſoul, more and more, from all filthineſs and uncleanneſs. Faith puts out all her vertue and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy in Ordinances, to the purging of<note place="margin">Sin is like the wilde Fig-tree, or Ivy in the Wall, cut off ſtump, body, bough, and branches; yet ſome ſprigs or other will ſprout out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, till the Wall be plucked down, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> ſouls from their droſs and Tin: Not that Faith in this life ſhall wholly pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie the ſoul from the being of ſin, or from the motions or operations of ſin, no; for then we ſhould have our Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in this world, and then we might bid Ordinances adue; but that faith that accompanies Salvation, doth na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally purifie and cleanſe the heart
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:169968:223"/> from the remainders of ſin by degrees. Sound Faith is ſtill a making the heart more and more, neat and clean, that the King of glory may delight in his habitation, that he may not remove his Court, but may abide with the ſoul for ever. And thus you ſee that that Faith that accompanies Salvation, is a heart-purifying Faith.</p>
               <p>The fifth Property of that Faith that accompanies Salvation, is this, It is ſoul ſoftning, ſoul mollifying, O nothing breaks the heart of a ſinner, like Faith. <hi>Peter</hi> believes ſoundly, and<note place="margin">Matth. 26. ult. Luke 7.</note> weeps bitterly, <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves much, and weeps much. Faith ſets a wounded Chriſt, a bruiſed Chriſt, a deſpiſed Chriſt, a peirced Chriſt, a bleeding Chriſt before the ſoul; and this makes the ſoul ſit down and weep bitterly. <hi>I will pour upon the</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Zach. 12. 10, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>houſe of</hi> David, <hi>the Spirit of Grace, and of Supplications: And they ſhall look upon him, whom they have pierced, and they ſhall mourn for him</hi> (All Goſpel-mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing flows from believing) <hi>as one mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for his onely ſon, and ſhall be in bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for him, as one that is in bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for his firſt-born.</hi> O the ſight of
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:169968:224"/> thoſe wounds, that their ſins have made, will wound their hearts, thorow and thorow, it will make them lament over Chriſt, with a bitter lamentation. They ſay, nothing will diſſolve the Adamant, but the Blood of a Goat. Ah, nothing will kindly, ſweetly, and effectually break the hardned heart of a ſinner, but Faiths beholding the Blood of Chriſt trickling down his ſides. <hi>Pliny</hi> reports of a Serpent, That when it ſtings, it fetches all the blood out of the body; but it was never heard that ever any ſweat blood, but Chriſt; and the very thoughts of this, makes the believing ſoul to ſit down ſweating, and weeping, That Chriſt ſhould love man, when he was moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lovely; that mans extream miſery, ſhould but inflame Chriſts bowels of love and mercy: This melts the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving ſoul, that Chriſt ſhould leave the eternal boſom of his Father; that he tha was equal with God, ſhould come in the form of a ſervant; that he that was cloathed with glory, and born a King, ſhould be wrapped in raggs; that he that the Heaven of Heavens could not contain, ſhould be cradled
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:169968:224"/> in a Manger; that from his Cradle, to his Croſs, his whole life ſhould be a life of ſorrows and ſufferings; that the Judge of all fleſh, ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned; that the Lord of Life, ſhould be put to death; that he that was his Fathers joy, ſhould in anguiſh of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, cry out, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me.</hi> That that head that was crowned with honor, ſhould be crowned with thorns; that thoſe eyes that were as a flame of fire, that were clearer then the Sun, ſhould be cloſed up by the darkneſs of death; that thoſe ears which were wont to hear nothing but <hi>Hallelujahs,</hi> ſhould hear nothing but Blaſphemies; that that face that was white and ruddy, ſhould be ſpit upon by the beaſtly Jews; that that tongue that ſpake, as never man ſpake, yea, as never Angel ſpake, ſhould be accuſed of blaſphemy; that thoſe hands which ſwayed both a Golden Scepter, and an Iron Rod; and thoſe feet that were as fine-braſs, ſhould be nailed to the Croſs; and all this for mans tranſgreſſion, for mans rebellion. O the ſight of theſe things, the believing of theſe things, the act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:169968:225"/> of Faith on theſe things, makes a gracious ſoul to break and bleed, to ſigh and groan, to mourn and lament: That Faith that accompanies Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is more or leſs a heart-breaking, a heart-melting Faith.</p>
               <p>The ſixt Property of that Faith that accompanies Salvation, is this, It is a world-conquering faith, it is a world over-coming faith. 1 <hi>John 5. 4. For whatſoever is born of God, over-cometh the world; and this is the victory that over-cometh the world, even our Faith.</hi> Faith overcomes the frowning world, and the fawning world, the tempting world, and the perſecuting world, and that it doth thus. Firſt, Faith by uniting the ſoul to Chriſt, doth intereſt the ſoul in all the victories and conqueſts of Chriſt, and ſo makes the ſoul a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror with Chriſt. <hi>John 16. ult. Theſe things have I ſpoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace, in the world you ſhall have tribulation; but be of good chear, I have overcome the world.</hi> We have to deal but with a conquered ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, our Jeſus hath given the world a mortal wound; we have nothing to do, but to ſet our feet upon a ſubdued
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:169968:225"/> enemy, and to ſing it out with the Apoſtle, <hi>Over all theſe, we are more then</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 37.</note> 
                  <hi>conquerors.</hi> Secondly, Faith over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the world by out-bidding fights, Faith out-bids the world, and ſo makes the ſoul victorious. The world ſet honors, pleaſures, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> before <hi>Moſes,</hi> but his Faith out-bid the world, it preſents the recompence of reward, it brings down all the glory, pleaſures, and treaſures of Heaven, of that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther world, and ſets them before the ſoul; and ſo it over-tops and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the world by out-bidding it; ſo Chriſt for the joy that was ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, endured the Croſs, deſpiſing<note place="margin">Heb. 12. 2.</note> the ſhame. Thirdly, Faith overcomes the world by telling the ſoul, that all things are its own; ſayes Faith, This God is thy God, this Chriſt is thy Chriſt, this Righteouſneſs is thy Righteouſneſs, this Promiſe is thy Promiſe, this Crown is thy Crown, this Glory is thy Glory; theſe Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures are thy Treaſures, theſe pleaſures<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 22.</note> are thy pleaſures. <hi>All things are yours</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>things preſent</hi> (are yours) <hi>and things to come</hi> are yours. Thus the Faith of the Martyrs acted,<note place="margin">Heb. 11. 35.</note>
                  <pb n="398" facs="tcp:169968:226"/> and ſo made them victorious over a tempting, and a perſecuting world. Fourthly, Faith overcomes the world by valuing the things of this world as they are; moſt men over-value them, they put too great a price upon them, they make the world a god, and then they cry, <hi>Great is</hi> Diana <hi>of the</hi> Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians. O but Faith now turns the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of all Creatures outward; Faith preſents all worldly things, as impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, as mixt, as mutable, as momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary to the ſoul, and ſo makes the ſoul victorious; Faith makes a man to ſee the prickles that be in every Roſe, the thorns that be in every Crown, the ſcabs that be under every Gown, the poyſon that is in the Golden Cup, the ſnare that is in the delicate diſh, the ſpot that is in the ſhining Pearl, and ſo makes a Chriſtian count and call all theſe things, as indeed they are, vanity of vanity; and ſo the believing ſoul<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Omnis vita in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelium pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum eſt, &amp; nibil bonum fine ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo bono.</hi> Aug. There is no good without Chriſt, the cheifeſt good.</note> ſlights the world, and tramples upon it, as dung and droſs. Fifthly and laſtly, Faith overcomes the world by preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Jeſus Chriſt to the ſoul, as a moſt excellent, glorious, and comprehenſive good, as ſuch a good that comprehends
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:169968:226"/> all good. Chriſt is that one good that comprehends all good, that one thing that comprehends all things. All the beauties, all the rarities, all the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies, all the riches, all the glories of all created Creatures are comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Chriſt. As the worth and value of many peices of ſilver, is connected in one peice of Gold, or in one pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Jewel, ſo all the whole volume of perfections which is ſpread thorow Heaven and Earth, is epitomized in Chriſt; and the ſight and ſenſe of this makes the ſoul to triumph over the world. Faith preſents more excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and better excellencies in Chriſt, then can be loſt for Chriſt, and ſo it makes the ſoul a conqueror. I have been long upon theſe things, becauſe they are of much weight, and worth, I ſhall be the briefer in what follows; but before I leave this point, I ſhall give you theſe hints.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place, I ſhall give you ſome hints concerning ſtrong Faith; in the ſecond place, I ſhall give you ſome hints concerning weak Faith. My deſign in both, is to keep precious ſouls from miſtaking and fainting,
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:169968:227"/> concerning ſtrong Faith, I ſhall give you theſe ſhort hints.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Strong Faith will make a ſoul reſolute in reſiſting, and happy in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering the ſtrongeſt temptations. <hi>Heb. 11. 3. Dan.</hi> 6.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It will make a man own God, and cleave to God, and hang upon God, in the face of the greateſt difficulties and dangers. <hi>Rom. 4. 18, &amp;c. Pſal.</hi> 44. 16, 17, 18. So <hi>Job</hi> will truſt<note place="margin">Job 13. 15, 16.</note> in God, though he ſlay him.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It will inable men to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer Chriſts Croſs, before the worlds crown, to prefer tortures, before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Strong Faith will make a ſoul divinely fearleſs, and divinely careleſs, it will make a man live as the childe lives in the family, without fear or care. <hi>Pſal. 23. 4. Dan. 3. We are not careful to anſwer thee, O King, our God whom we ſerve, is able to deliver us, and he will deliver us, &amp;c. Micah</hi> 7. 7, 8, 9.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Strong Faith will make a man cleave to the promiſe, when providence runs croſs to the promiſe. <hi>Num. 10. 29. 2 Chro. 20. 9, 10, 11. Pſal.</hi> 60. 6, 7.
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:169968:227"/> 
                  <hi>God hath ſpoken in his holineſs</hi> (ſaith <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>)<note place="margin">So <hi>Joſhua</hi> and <hi>Caleb.</hi> Numb. 14. 22, 23, 24.</note> 
                  <hi>I will rejoyce, I will divide</hi> Shechem, <hi>and mete out the valley of</hi> Succoth: Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lead <hi>is mine, and</hi> Manaſſeh <hi>is mine, &amp;c.</hi> Though <hi>David</hi> was in his Baniſhment, yet his faith accounts all his, as if he had all in poſſeſſion, and that becauſe God had ſpoken in his holineſs. His faith hangs upon the promiſe, though preſent Providences did run croſs to the Promiſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. Strong faith will make men com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with thoſe commands that do moſt croſs them, in their moſt deſirable comforts, <hi>Heb. 11. 8, 9. &amp; 10. 34. Gen.</hi> 22.</p>
               <p>Now, O precious Souls, you are not to argue againſt your own ſouls, that ſurely you have no faith, becauſe that<note place="margin">As it is dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to make falſe definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of ſin; ſo it is dangerous to make falſe definitions of grace.</note> your faith doth not lead you forth to ſuch and ſuch noble things; thou maiſt have true faith, though thou haſt not ſo great faith, as others of the Lords Worthies have had. The Philoſophers ſay, That there are eight degrees of heat; we diſcern three. Now if a man ſhould define heat onely by the higheſt degree, then all other degrees will be caſt out from being heat: So
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:169968:228"/> if a man ſhould define Faith onely by the higheſt degrees and operations of it, then that will be denied from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faith, that indeed is faith, as I ſhall preſently ſhew.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond place, I ſhall give you ſome hints concerning weak faith.</p>
               <p n="1">1. A weak faith doth as much ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie, and as much unite a man to Chriſt, as a ſtrong faith; It gives a man as much propriety and intereſt in Chriſt, as the ſtrongeſt faith in the world. The Babe hath as much inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt<note place="margin">But a Babe cannot im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, as he that is of grown yeers. 2 Pet. 1. 1.</note> in the Father, as he that is of grown years. A weak faith gives a man as good a title to Chriſt, and all the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious things of Eternity, as the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt faith in the world. A weak hand may receive a Pearl, as well as the ſtrong hand of a Gyant. Faith is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 1. 12.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The promiſes of Eternal Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs and Bleſſedneſs are not made over to the ſtrength of Faith, but to the truth of Faith; not to the degrees of Faith, but to the reality of Faith. He that believes ſhall be ſaved, though he hath not ſuch a ſtrength of Faith, as to ſtop the mouth of Lyons, as to
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:169968:228"/> work Miracles, as to remove Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,<note place="margin">Heb. 11. 33, 34, 35.</note> as to ſubdue Kingdoms, as to quench the violence of Fire, as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt ſtrong Temptations, as to rejoyce under great perſecutions. No man that is ſaved, is ſaved upon the account of the ſtrength of his faith, but upon the account of the truth of his faith. In the great day Chriſt will not bring bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lances to weigh mens graces, but a touch-ſtone to try their graces; He will not look ſo much at the ſtrength, as at the truth of their graces.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The weakeſt faith ſhall grow ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and ſtronger. A weak Believer ſhall<note place="margin">Rom. 1. 17. Heb. 12. 2.</note> go on from Faith to Faith. Chriſt is the finiſher, as well as the Author of our Faith. Chriſt will nurſe up this bleſſed Babe, and will not ſuffer it to be ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled in its infancy. He that hath begun a good work, will perfect it. Chriſt is as<note place="margin">Phil. 1. 6.</note> well bound to look after our graces, as he is to look after our ſouls. Grace is<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 5.</note> Chriſts work, therefore it muſt proſper in his hand; he is the great Builder and Repairer of our Graces; he will turn thy ſpark into a flame, thy drop<note place="margin">Mat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>h. 12. 20. &amp; 13. 32.</note> into an Ocean, thy penny into a pound, thy mite into a million: Therefore
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:169968:229"/> do not ſit down diſcouraged, becauſe thy faith is weak. That which is ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in weakneſs, ſhall riſe in power; Thy weak faith ſhall have a glorious Reſurrection: Chriſt will not ſuffer ſuch a Pearl of price to be buried un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a clod of Earth.</p>
               <p n="4">4. A little faith is faith, as a ſpark of fire is fire, a drop of water is water, a little Star is a Star, a little Pearl is a Pearl. Verily, thy little faith is a Jewel that God doth highly prize and<note place="margin">Matth. 18. 10.</note> value; and thy little faith will make thee put a higher price upon Chriſt,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 7.</note> and Grace, then upon all the world. Well, remember this, That the leaſt meaſure of true faith will bring thee to Salvation, and poſſeſs thee of Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as well as the greateſt meaſure. A little faith accompanies Salvation, as well as a great faith; a weak faith as well a ſtrong. Therefore do not ſay, O precious Soul, That thou haſt not that faith that accompanies Salvation, becauſe thou haſt not ſuch a ſtrong faith, or ſuch and ſuch degrees of faith. A great faith will yeeld a man a Heaven here; a little faith will yeeld him a Heaven hereafter.</p>
               <pb n="405" facs="tcp:169968:229"/>
               <p>The third thing that I am to ſhew you, is, What <hi>Repentance</hi> that is <hi>that accompanies Salvation.</hi> That Repentance doth accompany Salvation, I have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly ſhewed. Now I ſhall manifeſt in the following particulars what Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance that is that doth accompany Salvation, that comprehends Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, that boarders upon Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That Repentance that accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies Salvation, is a general, a univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal change of the whole man; a change in every part, though it be but in part. That Repentance that accompanies Salvation, changes both heart and life, word and work; it makes an <hi>Ethiopian</hi> an <hi>Iſraelite,</hi> a Leaper an Angel. Waſh ye, make you clean; there is the change of your hearts: Put away the<note place="margin">Iſa. 1. 16, 17, 18.</note> evil of your doings from before mine eyes, ceaſe to do evil, learn to do well; there is the change of their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices. So the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel, Caſt</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ezek. 18. 30, 31, 32. True Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is a tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row change both of the minde and manners.</note> 
                  <hi>away all your tranſgreſsions</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>whereby you have tranſgreſſed;</hi> there is the change of the life: And make you a new heart, and a new ſpirit; there is the change of the heart. That Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:169968:230"/> that accompanies Salvation,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Optima &amp; ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſſima paeniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia eſt nova vita,</hi> ſaith <hi>Luther.</hi> It is ſaid, that upon ones Preaching, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, Repent, for the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is at hand, There follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed almoſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very where, <hi>Delictorum pae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitentiae, morum reformatio, omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um contritio, ceſſabant blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemiae, aleae lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> works a change in the whole man; in all the qualities of the inward man, and in all the actions of the outward man. The Underſtanding is turned from darkneſs to light; the Will from a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſervility, to a holy liberty; the Affections from diſorder into order; the Heart from hardneſs into ſoftneſs: So in the outward man, the wanton eye is turned into an eye of chaſtity; the uncircumciſed ear is turned into an obedient ear; the hands of bribery are turned into hands of liberality; and the wandering feet of vanity, are turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into ways of purity. And verily, that Repentance that changes a man in ſome part, but not in every part, that onely makes a man a <hi>Herod,</hi> or an <hi>Agrippa,</hi> a half Chriſtian, an almoſt Chriſtian. That Repentance will never bring down Heaven into a mans boſom here, nor never bring a man up to Heaven hereafter. That Repentance that accompanies Salvation, makes a man all glorious within, and his ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment<note place="margin">Pſal. 45. 13.</note> to be of imbroidered gold; it ſtamps the Image of God, both upon the inward, and the outward man; it
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:169968:230"/> makes the heart like the Ark, all Gold within; and it makes the life like the Sun, all glorious without.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That Repentance that accompanies Salvation, is, a total turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as well as an univerſal turning; a turning from all ſin, without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation or exception. I hate and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor every falſe way, but thy Law do<note place="margin">Pſal. 119. True hatred is (<gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> againſt all. Jere. 33. 8 Ezek. 36. 25, 29, 33. 1 Iohn 1. 9. Repentance for ſin; is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing worth, without repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from ſin.</note> I love. So in <hi>Ezek. 18. 30. Therefore I will judge you, O houſe of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>every one according to his ways, ſaith the Lord God, Repent and turn your ſelves from all your tranſgreſsions, ſo iniquity ſhall not be your ruine.</hi> So in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. 11. As <hi>Noahs</hi> flood drowned his neereſt, and his deareſt friends; ſo the flood of penitent tears drowns mens neereſt and their deareſt luſts. Be they <hi>Iſaacs</hi> or <hi>Benjamins,</hi> be they right eyes, or right hands, Repentance that accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies Salvation, puts all to the Sword; it ſpares neither Father nor Mother, neither <hi>Agag</hi> nor <hi>Achan;</hi> it caſts off all the rags of old <hi>Adam;</hi> it leaves not a Horn, nor a Hoof behinde; it throws down every ſtone of the old building; it ſcrapes off all Leviathans skales: it waſheth away all leprous ſpots. <hi>Ezek.</hi>
                  <pb n="408" facs="tcp:169968:231"/> 14. 6. <hi>Therefore ſay unto the houſe of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>thus ſaith the Lord God, Repent, and turn your ſelves from your Idols, and turn away your faces from all your abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> Sin is a turning the back upon God, and the face towards Hell; but Repentance is a turning the back upon ſin, and a ſetting the face towards God. He that looks upon <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<note place="margin">Thus did <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Judas</hi> to their eternal ruine. Jam. 2. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>Babylon,</hi> with a learing eye at the ſame time; He that looks upon God, and at the ſame time looks upon any ſin with a learing eye, hath not yet reached unto this Repentance that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companies Salvation; his Repentance and Profeſſion cannot ſecure him from double damnation: He that ſerves God in ſomethings, and his luſts in other things, ſayes to God as <hi>David</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Sam. 19. One ſtab ar the heart kills, one hole in the ſhip ſinks her, one act of treaſon makes a Traytor: So one ſin not forſaken, not turned from, will undo a ſoul for ever. Sin ever ends tragically, and this puts the penitent in battel array againſt every ſin.</note> ſaid to <hi>Mephiboſheth</hi> concerning his Lands, <hi>Thou and</hi> Ziba <hi>divide the Lands,</hi> So thou and Satan divide my ſoul, my heart between you: Ah doth not ſuch a ſoul deſerve a double Hell? Chriſt takes every ſin at a penitent mans hands, as <hi>Caeſar</hi> did his wounds from him, of whom he merited better uſage, with <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>And thou my ſon?</hi> What thou wound me? what
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:169968:231"/> thou ſtob me? that ſhouldſt venture thy own blood to ſave mine. There are no wounds that are ſo grievous and terrible to Chriſt, as thoſe that he receives in the houſe of his friends. And this ſets the penitent mans heart and hand againſt every thing that makes againſt Chriſt. A true penitent looks upon every ſin as poyſon, as the vomit of a dog, as the mire of the<note place="margin">Iſa. 30. 22. <hi>Nihil in lege menſtruato im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mundius.</hi> Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron.</note> ſtreet, as the menſtruous cloath, which of all things in the Law was moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean, defiling, and polluting, (<hi>Pliny</hi> ſaith, that the very Trees with touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, would become barren.) And his looking thus upon every ſin, turns his heart againſt every ſin, and makes him not onely to refrain from ſin, but to forſake it, and to loath it more then Hell.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That Repentance that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companies Salvation, is, not onely a<note place="margin">Iſa. 1. The Hebrew word for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance is from <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>Shob,</hi> which ſignifies to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, implying a going back from what a man had done.</note> turning from all ſin, but it is alſo a turning unto God; it is not onely a ceaſing from doing evil, but it is alſo a learning to do well; it is not onely a turning from darkneſs, but it is alſo a turning to light, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Acts 26. 18. To open their eyes, and to
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:169968:232"/> turn them from darkneſs to light, and</hi>
                  <note place="margin">It notes a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting from one thing to another, as from ſin to God, from evil to good, from Hell to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</note> 
                  <hi>from the power of Satan unto God:</hi> So in <hi>Iſa. 55. 7. Let the wicked forſake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts, and let him return unto the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> It is not enough for the man of iniquity to forſake his evil way, but he muſt alſo return unto the Lord; he muſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject his heart to the power of Divine Grace, and his life to the Will and Word of God. As Negative goodneſs can never ſatisfie a gracious ſoul, ſo Negative goodneſs can never ſave a ſinful ſoul. It is not enough that thou art not thus and thus bad, but thou muſt be thus and thus good, or thou art undone for ever. <hi>Ezek. 18. 21. But if the wicked will turn from all his ſins that he hath committed, and keep all my Statutes, and do that which is lawful and right, he ſhall ſurely live, he ſhall not die.</hi> Negative Righteouſneſs and Holineſs is no Righteouſneſs no Holineſs, in the account of God. It was not the Phariſees Negative Righteouſneſs, nor<note place="margin">Luke 18. 5. Matth. 20. 13, 14.</note> his Comparative Goodneſs, that could prevent his being rejected of God, his being ſhut out of Heaven, his burning in Hell. It is not enough that the Tree
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:169968:232"/> hears no ill fruit, but it muſt bring forth good fruit, elſe it muſt be cut down and caſt into the fire; that Tree that is not for fruit is for the fire. <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 7. 19. He that holds nor wholly with Chriſt, doth very ſhamefully neglect Chriſt. <hi>Aut totum me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum tene, aut totum omitte.</hi> Greg. Nazian. And therfore if Chriſt trample upon them at laſt, it is juſt.</note> 
                  <hi>tree that brings not forth good fruit</hi> (ſayes Chriſt) <hi>is hewn down and caſt into the fire.</hi> Men that content themſelves with Negative Righteouſneſs, ſhall finde at laſt Heaven Gates bolted upon them with a double bolt. All that Negative Righteouſneſs and Holineſs can do, is to help a man to one of the beſt Chambers, and eaſieſt Beds in Hell: That Repentance that accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies Salvation, brings the heart and life, not onely off from ſin, but on to God; it makes a man not onely ceaſe from walking in the wayes of death, but it makes him walk in the wayes of life. <hi>They do no iniquity, they walk in his wayes.</hi> Pſal. 119. 3.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, That Repentance that accompanies Salvation, ſtrikes moſt<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Auguſtine</hi> a great ſinner wrote Twelve Books of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and walked moſt croſs to the particular ſins he had moſt lived in.</note> effectually, and particularly, againſt that ſin or ſins, that the ſinner was moſt apt and prone to before his Converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The hand of Repentance is moſt againſt that ſin, it is moſt upon that ſin that the ſoul hath looked moſt
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:169968:233"/> with a learing eye upon. The chief and principal ſins that <hi>Iſrael</hi> was guilty of, was idolatry and ſinful compliance; Now when God works kindly upon them, they put the hand of Repentance upon thoſe particular ſins, as you may ſee <hi>Iſa. 27. 9. By this therefore ſhall the</hi>
                  <note place="margin">This was the great ſin of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but after their return out of captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, they never ſet up Idols more, but were wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful zealous to keep their Temple from ſuch defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, both in the time of <hi>Antiochus Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanes,</hi> and of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and do accunt them as a men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruous cloth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to this very day.</note> 
                  <hi>iniquity of</hi> Jacob <hi>be purged, and this is all the fruit to take away his ſin: When he maketh all the ſtones of the Altar, as Chalk ſtones, that are beaten in ſunder, the groves and images ſhall not ſtand up.</hi> Here you ſee, when God appears, and acts graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly for, and towards his people, they put the hand of Repentance upon their Groves and Images, theſe muſt down, theſe muſt no longer ſtand: The Groves and the Images ſhall not ſtand up, they ſhall be utterly abandoned and deſtroyed, demoliſhed and aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. So in <hi>Iſa. 30. 22. Ye ſhall defile alſo the covering of thy graven Images of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and the ornament of thy molten Images of Gold: Thou ſhalt caſt them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way as a menſtruous cloth; thou ſhalt ſay unto it, Get thee hence.</hi> Here you ſee the hand of Repentance is againſt their Idols of Silver and Gold, and not onely againſt their Idols, but alſo
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:169968:233"/> againſt whatſoever had any relation to them. Now they ſhew nothing but a deteſtation of their Idols, and a holy indignation againſt them; Get you<note place="margin">The Jews were willing in the <hi>Romans</hi> time, rather to die then to ſuffer the Eagle, the Imperial Arms, to be ſet up in the Temple.</note> hence. The hand of Repentance makes a divorce between them and their Idols, between their Souls and their eſpecial Sins. Now they are as much in hating, abhorring, abominating, and contemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Idols and Images, as they were formerly in adoring, worſhipping, and honoring of them. So <hi>Mary Magda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi> in the ſeventh of <hi>Luke,</hi> walks quite croſs and contrary to her former ſelf, her ſinful ſelf, ſhe croſſes the fleſh, in thoſe very things wherein formerly ſhe did gratifie the fleſh. So the penitent Jailor in that ſixteenth of the <hi>Acts,</hi> waſhes thoſe very wounds that his own bloody hands had made: He acts in wayes of mercy, quite contrary to his former cruelty: At firſt there was none ſo fierce, ſo furious, ſo cruel, ſo bloody, ſo inhumane in his carriage to the Apoſtles; at laſt, none ſo gentle, ſo ſoft, ſo ſweet, ſo curteous, ſo affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate to them. The ſame you may ſee in <hi>Zacheus</hi> in the nineteenth of <hi>Luke;</hi> In <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> the ninth; and in
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:169968:234"/> 
                  <hi>Manaſſe,</hi> in that of the ſecond of <hi>Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles,</hi> chap. 33. 6.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, That Repentance that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companies Salvation, is, very large and comprehenſive; it comprehends and takes in theſe following particulars, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides thoſe already named.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It takes in a ſight and ſenſe of ſin. Men muſt firſt ſee their ſins, they muſt be ſenſible of their ſins, before they can repent of their ſins. <hi>Ephraim</hi> had firſt a ſight of his ſin, and then he repents and turns from his ſin. <hi>After I was inſtructed, I ſmote upon my thigh, Jer.</hi> 31. 18, 19.

The true Penitent can ſay with <hi>Vivaldus,</hi> I hide not my ſins, but I ſhew them; I wipe them not away, but I ſprinkle them; I do not excuſe them, but I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe them; (<hi>Peccata enim non nocent, ſi non placent,</hi>) My ſins hurt me not, if I like them not: The beginning of my Salvation is the knowledge of my tranſgreſſion.</p>

               <p>Fifthly, That Repentance that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companies Salvation, comprehends loathing and abhorring of ſin, and of<note place="margin">

Ezek. 16. 61, 62, 63. Amos 5. 15. Ezek. 20. 41, 42, 43. And ye ſhall remember your ways, and all your doings, wherein ye have been defiled; and ye ſhall loath your ſelves in your own ſight, for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="419" facs="tcp:169968:236"/> have committed.</hi> The ſincere penitent loaths his ſins, and he loaths himſelf alſo, becauſe of his ſins. He crys out, O theſe wanton eies, O theſe wicked hands, O this deceiptful tongue, O this crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed will, O this corrupt heart! O how do I loath my ſins, how do I loath my ſelf, how do I loath ſinful-ſelf, and how do I loath my natural-ſelf, becauſe of ſinful-ſelf! My ſins are a burden to me, and they make me a burden to my ſelf; my ſins are an abhorring to me, and they make me abhor my ſelf in duſt and aſhes. A true Penitent hath not onely low thoughts of himſelf, but loathſome thoughts of himſelf; none can think or ſpeak ſo vilely of him, as he doth, and will think and ſpeak of himſelf. <hi>Ezek. 6. 9. And they that eſcape of you, ſhall remember me among the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, whither they ſhall be carried cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, becauſe I am broken with their whoriſh heart,</hi> (as the heart of a Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band is at the adulterous carriage of his wife) <hi>which hath departed from me, and with their eyes, which go a whoring after their Idols; and they ſhall loath themſelves for evils which they have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in all their abominations.</hi> If thy
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:169968:237"/> Repentance do not work thee out with<note place="margin">Some people can ſhed tears for nothing, ſome for any thing, but a ſound penitent ſheds more tears for his ſins, then he doth for his ſufferings.</note> thy ſins, and thy ſins work thee out of love with thy ſelf, thy Repentance is not that Repentance that accompanies Salvation. And thus you ſee the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular things that that Repentance that doth accompany Salvation doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend and include.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, That Repentance that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companies Salvation, hath theſe choice companions attending of it. Firſt, Faith. <hi>Zach. 12. 10, 11. They ſhall look upon him whom they have pierced, and mourn, &amp;c.</hi> Mourning and beleeving go together. So in <hi>Matth. 4. 17. Mark 1. 14, 15. Now after that</hi> John <hi>was put in priſon, Jeſus came into Galilee, Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Goſpel of the Kingdom of God; And ſaying, The time is fulfilled, and the Kingdom of God is at hand: Repent ye, and believe the Goſpel.</hi> Secondly, Love to Chriſt doth always accompany that Repentance that accompanies Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as you may ſee in <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> in that ſeventh of <hi>Luke.</hi> Thirdly, A filial fear of offending God, and a holy care to honor God, doth always ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companie that Repentance that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companies Salvation. 2 <hi>Cor. 7. 11. For
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:169968:237"/> godly ſorrow worketh Repentance to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Repentance is, <hi>poſt naufragium tabula,</hi> the fair daughter of a foul mother. Repentance is a fruitful Womb.</note> 
                  <hi>not to be repented of; for behold this ſelf ſame thing that ye ſorrowed after a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſort, what carefulneſs it wrought in you, yea, what clearing of your ſelves, yea, what indignation, yea, what fear, yea, what vehement deſire, yea, what zeal, yea, what revenge: In all things ye have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved your ſelves to be clear in this matter.</hi> Verily, Repentance to life hath all theſe lively companions attending of it; they are born together, and will live together, till the penitent ſoul changes Earth for Heaven, Grace for Glory.</p>
               <p>Seventhly and laſtly, That Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance that accompanies Salvation, is a continued act, a Repentance never to be<note place="margin">2 Cor. 7. 10.</note> repented of. Repentance is a continual ſpring, where the waters of godly ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row are alwayes flowing. A ſound Penitent is ſtill a turning nearer and nearer to God; he is ſtill a turning further and further from ſin: This makes the Penitent Soul to ſigh and<note place="margin">Rom. 7.</note> mourn, that he can get no nearer to God, that he can get no further from ſin: The work of Repentance is not the work of an hour, a day, a yeer, but the work of this life. A ſincere Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:169968:238"/> makes as much conſcience of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Quid reſtat ò peccator niſi ut in tota vita tua deplores totam vitam tuam.</hi> Anſelmus. O then, what then remains, but in our whole life, to lament the ſins of our whole life.</note> daily, as he doth of believing daily; and he can as eaſily content himſelf with one act of Faith, or Love, or Joy, as he can content him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with one act of Repentance. <hi>My ſins are ever before me,</hi> ſayes <hi>David.</hi> Next to my being kept from ſin, I count it the greateſt mercy in the world, to be ſtill a mourning over ſin, ſayes the Penitent ſoul. The Penitent ſoul never ceaſes repenting, till he cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes living. He goes to Heaven with the joyful tears of Repentance in his eyes: He knows that his whole life is but a day of ſowing tears, that he may at laſt reap everlaſting joyes. That Repentance that accompanies Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is a final forſaking of ſin; It is a bidding ſin an everlaſting adieu; it is a taking an eternal farwel of ſin, a never turning to folly more, <hi>What have I to do any more with Idols?</hi> ſays <hi>Ephraim, Hoſ.</hi> 14. 8. I have taſted of the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that is in ſin, I have taſted of the ſweetneſs of divine mercy in pardoning of ſin; therefore away ſin, I will never have to do with you more; you have robbed Chriſt of his ſervice, and me
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:169968:238"/> of my comfort and crown: Away, away ſin, you ſhall never be courted, nor countenanced by me more. That man that onely puts off his ſins in the day of adverſity, as he doth his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments at night when he goes to bed, with an intent to put them on again in the morning of proſperity, never yet truly repented. He is a dog that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns to the vomit again, he is a ſwine that returns to the wallowing in the mire; ſuch a dog was <hi>Judas,</hi> ſuch a ſwine was <hi>Demas.</hi> It is an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary vanity in ſome men, to lay aſide their ſins before ſolemn duties, but with a purpoſe to return to them again; as the Serpent layeth aſide his poyſon when he goeth to drink, and when he hath drunk, he returns to it again, as they fable it. It is ſad when men ſay to their luſts, as <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaid to his ſervants, <hi>Abide you here, and I will go and worſhip and return again to you, Gen.</hi> 22. 5. Verily ſuch ſouls are far off from that Repentance that accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies Salvation, for that makes a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and everlaſting ſeparation between ſin and the ſoul; it makes ſuch a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce between ſin and the ſoul, and
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:169968:239"/> puts them ſo far a ſunder, that all the world can never bring them to meet as two lovers together. The Penitent Soul looks upon ſin, and deals with ſin, not as a friend, but as an enemy; it deals with ſin as <hi>Amnon</hi> dealt with <hi>Tamar, 2 Sam. 13. 15. And</hi> Amnon <hi>hated her exceedingly, ſo that the hatred wherewith he hated her, was greater then the love wherewith he had loved her: And</hi> Amnon <hi>ſaid unto her, Ariſe, be gone.</hi> Juſt thus doth the Penitent Soul carry it ſelf towards ſin.</p>
               <p>And thus you ſee what Repentance that is that accompanies Salvation.</p>
               <p>The fourth thing I am to ſhew, is, What <hi>Obedience</hi> that is that doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company Salvation: That Obedience doth accompany Salvation, I have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly proved. Now what this Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is that doth accompany or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend Salvation, I ſhall ſhew you in theſe following particulars.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That Obedience that accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies Salvation, is cordial and hearty, the heart, the inward man doth an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer and eccho to the Word and Will of God. The Believer knows, That no Obedience, but hearty Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:169968:239"/> is acceptable to Chriſt; he knows<note place="margin">Iſa. 29. 13. Matth. 15. 7, 8, 9. The heart is (<hi>Cam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Chriſt was hearty in his obedience for me (ſayes the Believer) and ſhall not I be hearty in my obedience to him? Chriſt will lay his hand of love, his hand of acceptance, upon no obedience, but what flows from the heart. <hi>Rom. 6. 9. Ye have obeyed from the heart, that form of doctrine which was delivered you.</hi> So in <hi>Rom. 7. ult. So then with the minde, I myſelf ſerve the Law of God.</hi> My heart ſayes <hi>Paul,</hi> is in my obedience. So in <hi>Rom. 1. 9. God is my witneſs, whom I ſerve with my ſpirit in the Goſpel of his Son.</hi> Many ſerve God with their bodies, but I ſerve him with my ſpirit; many ſerve him with the outward man, but I ſerve him with my inward man. God hath written his Law in<note place="margin">Ezek. 36. 26, 27.</note> Believers hearts, and therefore they cannot but obey it from the heart. <hi>I delight to do thy will, O my God</hi> (how ſo?) <hi>why thy Law is within my heart;</hi> or, <hi>in the midst of my bowels,</hi> as the Hebrew<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </note> hath it. The heart within ecchoes and anſwers to the Commandments with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, as a Book written anſwers to his
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:169968:240"/> minde that writes it; as face anſwers to face, as the impreſſion on the wax anſwers to the character engraven on the ſeal. The Scribes and Phariſees were much in the outward obedience of the Law, but their hearts were not in their obedience; and therefore all they did, ſignified nothing in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Chriſt, who is onely taken with outward actions as they flow from the heart and affections; their ſouls were not in their ſervices, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all their ſervices were loſt ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices. They were very glorious in<note place="margin">Matth. 23.</note> their outward profeſſion, but their hearts were as filthy Sepulchres; their out-ſides ſhined as the Sun, but their in-ſides were as black as Hell. They were like the <hi>Egyptians</hi> Temples, beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful without, but filthy within. Well, remember this, No action, no ſervice goes for current in Heaven, but that which is ſealed up with integrity of heart. God will not be put off with the ſhell, when we give the Devil the Kernel.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That Obedience that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companies Salvation, is univerſal as well as cordial; the ſoul falls in with
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:169968:240"/> every part and point of Gods will, ſo far as he knows it, without prejudice or partiality, without tilting the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance on one ſide or another. A ſoul<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Non eligit man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>data,</hi> He doth not pick and chuſe. He obeyes all in reſpect of his ſincere pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, deſire, and endeavor; and this God accepts in Chriſt, for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> ſincerely obedient, will not pick and chuſe what commands to obey, and what to reject, as Hypocrites do; he hath an eye to ſee, an ear to hear, and a heart to obey the firſt Table as well as the ſecond, and the ſecond as well as the firſt; he doth not adhere to the firſt and neglect the ſecond, as Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites do; neither doth he adhere to the ſecond and contemn the firſt, as prophane men do; he obeys not out of humor, but out of duty; he obeys not out of choice, but out of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. <hi>Pſal. 119. 6. Then ſhall I not be aſhamed, when I have reſpect unto all thy Commandments.</hi> Look as Faith never ſingles out his object, but layes hold on every object God holds forth for it to cloſe with; Faith doth not chuſe this truth, and reject that, it doth not cloſe with one, and reject another; Faith doth not ſay, I will truſt God in this caſe, but not in that; I will truſt him for this mercy, but not for that mercy; I will truſt him in this way,
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:169968:241"/> but not in that way; Faith doth not chuſe its object; Faith knows that he is powerful and faithful that hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, and therefore Faith cloſes with one object, as well as another: So a true obedient ſoul ſingles not out the commands of God, as to obey one, and rebel againſt another; it dares not, it cannot ſay, I will ſerve God in this command, but not in that. No: In an Evangelical ſenſe it obeyes all, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 5, 6. Zacharias <hi>and</hi> Elizabeth <hi>were both righteous before God, walking in all</hi>

                     </gap>, Without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint. An obedient ſoul is like a chryſtal glaſs with a light in the midſt, which ſhines forth thorow every part thereof: So that Royal Law that is written upon his hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

They were good ſouls, and good at both. A man ſincerely obedient layes ſuch a charge upon his whole man, as <hi>Mary,</hi> the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Chriſt, did upon all the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants at the Feaſt, <hi>John 2. 5. Whatever the Lord ſaith unto you, do it.</hi> Eyes, ears, hands, heart, lips, legs, body, and ſoul, do you all ſeriouſly and affectionately obſerve what ever Jeſus Chriſt ſayes unto you, and do it: So <hi>David</hi> doth, <hi>Pſal. 119. 34, 69. Give me underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:169968:241"/> and I ſhall keep thy Law; yea, I ſhall obſerve it with my whole heart. The proud have forged a lie againſt me; but I will keep thy Precepts with my whole heart.</hi> The whole heart includes all the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the ſoul, and all the members of the body; ſayes <hi>David,</hi> I will put hand and heart, body and ſoul, all within me, and all without me, to the keeping and obſerving of thy Precepts. Here is a ſoul thorow-paced in his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, he ſtands not halting nor halving of it; he knows the Lord loves to be ſerved truly and totally, and therefore he obeys with an entire heart, and a ſincere ſpirit. I have read of a very ſtrange ſpeech that dropped out of the mouth of <hi>Epictetus,</hi> a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, <hi>If it be thy will</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>O Lord, command me what thou wilt, ſend me whither thou wilt, I will not withdraw my ſelf from any thing that ſeems good to thee.</hi> Ah how will this Heathen at laſt riſe in judgement againſt all <hi>Sauls, Jehues, Judaſes, Demaſes,</hi> Scribes, Phariſees, Temporaries, who are partial in their obedience, who while they yeeld obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to ſome commands, live in the habitual breach of other commands?
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:169968:242"/> Verily, he that lives in the habitual breach of one command, ſhall at laſt be reputed by God guilty of the breach<note place="margin">Jam. 2. 10.</note> of every command, and God accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly will in a way of Juſtice proceed againſt him, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. 10, 11, 12, 13. It was the glory of <hi>Caleb</hi> and <hi>Joſhua,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Num. 14. 24.</note> that they followed the Lord fully in one thing, as well as another. So <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius,</hi>

                  <hi>We are preſent before God to hear whatſoever ſhall be commanded us of God;</hi> He doth not pick and chuſe: So in <hi>Acts 13. 22.

He mindes not onely general duties of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, but alſo particular du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, as a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, as a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, as a Son, as a Servant.</note> 
                  <hi>wills:</hi> To note the univerſallity and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity of his Obedience. A ſincere heart loves all commands of God, and prizes all commands of God, and ſees a Divine Image ſtamped upon all the commands of God, and therefore the main bent and diſpoſition of his ſoul, is to obey all, to ſubject to all. God commands univerſal obedience, <hi>Joſh. 1. 8. Deut. 5. 29. Ezek.</hi> 18. The Promiſe of Reward is made over to Univerſal Obedience, <hi>Pſal. 19. 11. Joſh.</hi> 1. 8. Univerſal Obedience is a
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:169968:242"/> Jewel that all will wiſh for, or rejoyce in, at the day of death, and the day of account; And the remembrance of theſe things, with others of the like nature, provokes all upright ſouls to be impartial, to be univerſal in their Obedience.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That Obedience that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companies Salvation, ſprings from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Spiritual cauſes, and from holy and heavenly Motives, it flowes from Faith. Hence it is called, <hi>The obedience of Faith, Rom.</hi> 16. 26. So in 1 <hi>Tim. 1. 5. Now the end of the Commandment, is Love out of a pure Heart, and of a good Conſcience, and of Faith unfeigned.</hi> Faith draws down that Divine Vertue and Power into the ſoul, that makes it live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and active, abundant and conſtant in the work and way of the Lord. And<note place="margin">Where Love is, the Soul ſays of every com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, <hi>Bonus Sermo,</hi> it is a good ſaying; but where Love is wanting, the man cryes out, <hi>Durus Sermo,</hi> It is a hard ſaying, who can bear it.</note> as Faith, ſo Love puts the Soul for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in ways of Obedience. <hi>John 14. 21, 23. If any man love me, he will keep my Commandments.</hi> So <hi>Pſal. 119. 48. My hands alſo will I lift up to thy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, which I have loved.</hi> Divine Love is ſaid to be the keeping of the Commandments, becauſe it puts the Soul upon keeping them. Divine Love
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:169968:243"/> makes every weight light, every yoke eaſie, every command joyous; it knows no difficulties, it facilitates obedience, it divinely conſtrains the ſoul to obey, to walk, to run the ways of Gods commands. And as ſound Obedience ſprings from Faith and Love, ſo it flows from a filial Fear of God, <hi>Pſal. 118. 119. Mine heart ſtands in aw of thy Word.</hi> So <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 7. Noah <hi>being warned of God, touching things not ſeen, as yet, moved with fear, prepared an Ark.</hi>

               <p>Ah but Hypocrites and Tempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries are not carried forth in their Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, from ſuch precious, and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous principles; and therefore it is, that God caſts all their ſervices as dung in<note place="margin">Iſa. 1. 11.</note> their faces. And as that Obedience which accompanies Salvation flows from inward Spiritual Principles, ſo it flows from holy and heavenly Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, as from the taſtes of Divine Love, and the ſweetneſs and excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of communion with God, and the choice and precious diſcoveries that the ſoul in wayes of Obedience hath<note place="margin">Iſa. 64. 5.</note> had of the beauty and glory of God. The ſweet looks, the heavenly words,
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:169968:243"/> the glorious kiſſes, the holy embraces that the obedient ſoul hath had, makes it freely and fully obedient to the Word and Will of God. Ah! but all the Motives that move Hypocrites and carnal Profeſſors to Obedience, are onely external and carnal, as the eye of<note place="margin">Matth. 6.</note> the Creature, the ear of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the applauſe of the Creature, the rewards of the Creature; either the love of the loaves, or the gain of<note place="margin">John 6.</note> cuſtom, or the deſire of ambition: ſometimes they are moved to obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence from the fear of the Creature, and ſometimes from the want of the<note place="margin">Hoſ. 7. 14.</note> Creature, and ſometimes from the example of the Creature, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times from vows made to the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; ſometimes the frowns of God,<note place="margin">Hoſ. 5. ult.

Their Obedience always flows from ſome
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:169968:244"/> low, baſe, carnal, corrupt conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or other. O but that Obedience that accompanies Salvation, doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways flow (as you ſee) from inward and Spiritual cauſes, and from holy and heavenly Motives.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, That Obedience that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companies Salvation, is a ready, free, willing, and chearful Obedience. Firſt; It is ready Obedience. <hi>Pſal. 27. 8. When thou ſaidſt, Seek ye my face, my heart ſaid unto thee, Thy face, Lord, will I ſeek.</hi> Pſal. 119. 60. <hi>I made haſte, and delayed not to keep thy Commandments.</hi> Pſal. 18. 44. <hi>Aſſoon as they hear of me, they ſhall o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey me; the ſtrangers ſhall ſubmit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unto me.</hi> I have read of one who<note place="margin">

O how ready then doth Grace make the Soul, to obey thoſe Divine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands that are backed with the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, ſtrongeſt, and choiceſt Arguments! Secondly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> As that Obedience that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companies Salvation, is ready Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; ſo it is free and willing Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.

                  <hi>Acts 21. 13. Then</hi> Paul <hi>anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi>

                     </gap>.</note> not onely to their power, but beyond their power. All the motions and actings of Chriſt towards his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, for his people, and in his people, are free; He loves them freely, he par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons them freely, he intercedes for them freely, he acts them freely, and he ſaves them freely; and ſo they move and act towards Chriſt freely; they heat, they pray, they wait, they weep, they work, they watch, freely and willingly, that Spirit of Grace and<note place="margin">1 Chron. 29. 6-18. 1 Tim. 6. 18. 1 Theſ. 2. 8. A Saint at worſt is obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, either</note> Holineſs that is in them, makes them Voluntiers in all Religious duties and ſervices.

Yet nature a little raiſed and refined, will inable a man to do this; will not Grace, will not Union and Communion with Chriſt, inable a man to do as much, yea infinitly more? Thirdly, As that Obedience that accompanies Salvation, is free and willing Obedience, ſo it is cheerful and delightful Obedience; it is a Believers meat and drink, it is his joy and crown, it is a pleaſure, a para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe to his ſoul, to be ſtill obeying his Fathers will, to be ſtill found about his Fathers buſineſs. <hi>Pſal. 40. 8.

                  <pb n="437" facs="tcp:169968:245"/> that is, in the ſtudying and obeying of his Commandments. <hi>Pſal. 119. 16.

The love of Chriſt, the diſcoveries of Chriſt, the embraces of Chriſt, make a gracious ſoul ſtudious and induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to keep the Commandments of Chriſt, in lip and life, in word and work, in head and heart, in book and breſt.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee that that Obedience that accompanies Salvation, is, Ready, Free, and Chearful Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, That Obedience that ac<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>companies Salvation, is, Peremptory Obedience, <hi>Joſh. 24. 15. I and my</hi>

So <hi>Paul</hi> was obedient to<note place="margin">Acts 20. 23. Gal. 1. 15, 16. You may as well ſtop the Sun from run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his race, as you are able to hinder gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſouls from obeying Divine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.

So the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature makes gracious ſouls peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory in their Obedience.</note> the heavenly viſion, though bonds did attend him in every place; he is better at obeying, then at diſputing; <hi>I conferred not</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>with fleſh and blood:</hi> So <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> and the reſt of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, in deſpight of all threatnings and beatings, they obey the Lord, they keep faſt and cloſe to their Maſters work. <hi>Whether it be right in the fight of God, to hearken more unto you, then unto God, judge ye; for we cannot but ſpeak the things which we have ſeen and heard. And now Lord, behold their threatnings, and grant unto thy ſervants, that with all boldneſs they may ſpeak thy Word. And when they had called the Apoſtles, and bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten them, they commanded that they ſhould not ſpeak in the Name of Jeſus, and let them go. And they departed from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Council, rejoycing, that they

               <p>Thus you ſee, no tryals, no troubles, no terrors, no threats, no dangers, no deaths, could deter them from pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory Obedience to Divine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts. It is not the Fiery Furnace, nor the Lyons Den, nor the Bloody Sword, nor the Torturing Wrack that can fright gracious Souls from their Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to their deareſt Lord. <hi>Pſal. 119. 106.

Look as the light of the Sun doth extinguiſh, and put out the light of the fire; ſo when a man makes the glory of God his end, that end will extinguiſh and put out all carnal, low, baſe ends. That man that makes himſelf the end of his actions, that makes honor, riches, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the end of his actions, he muſt at laſt lie down in eternal ſorrow, he muſt dwell in everlaſting burnings;<note place="margin">Iſai 50. ult. &amp; 33. 14.</note> the man is as his end is, and his work is as his end is; if that be naught, all is naught; if that be good, all is good, and the man is happy for ever.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, That Obedience that accompanies Salvation, that borders upon Salvation, that comprehends<note place="margin">

But becauſe I have in this Treatiſe, ſpoke at large of the ſufferings of the Saints, I ſhall ſay no more of it in this place. And thus you ſee what that Obedience is that accompanies Salvation.

Divine Love is not ſtinted nor limited to one ſort of duty, but is free to all: He that loveth, flieth; he that loveth, runneth; he that loveth, believeth; he that loveth, rejoyceth; he that loveth, mourneth; he that loveth, giveth; he that loveth, lendeth; he that loveth, beareth; he that loveth, waiteth; he that loveth, hopeth, <hi>&amp;c.

That Love that accompanies Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is real and cordial Love, it is ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere and upright love; it makes the Soul love (Chriſt) the giver, more then the gift; it makes the Soul love the gift for the givers ſake, it will make the Soul to love the giver with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his gifts.</p>
               <p>And verily, they ſhall not be long without good gifts from Chriſt, that love Chriſt more then his gifts. <hi>Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſian</hi> commanded a liberal reward ſhould be given to a woman that came, and profeſſed, That ſhe was in love with him; and when his Steward asked him, What <hi>item</hi> he ſhould put to it in his Book of Accounts; the Emperor anſwered, <hi>Veſpaſiano adamato, Item</hi> to

Surely, Chriſt will not be worſe then a Heathen, he will not act below a Heathen. He ſhall never be a loſer that loves Chriſt for that Spiritual ſweetneſs, and lovelineſs that is in Chriſt, Chriſt will not live long in that mans debt.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, That Love that accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies Salvation, is a vehement Love, an ardent Love; it is a ſpark of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly fire, and it puts all the affections into a holy flame. <hi>Can. 1. 7.

The love of Chriſt to Believers, is a vehement love, an ardent love (witneſs his leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Fathers boſom, his putting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us his Royal Robes, his bleeding, his dying, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) And it doth naturally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get<note place="margin">

Where Chriſt loves, he always begets ſomewhat like himſelf, <hi>Amor ſemper habet, quid ſui ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mile.</hi> That love that is flat, luke-warm, or cold, will leave a man to freeze a this ſide Heaven, it will fit him for the warmeſt place in Hell. <hi>Dives</hi> love was very cold, and he found the flames of Hell to be very hot. That love that
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:169968:254"/> accompanies Salvation is full of heat and fire.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, That Love that accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies Salvation, is laſting Love, it is permanent Love; the objects of it are laſting, the ſprings and cauſes of it are laſting, the nature of it is laſting. The Primitive Chriſtians loved not<note place="margin">Revel. 12. 11.</note> their lives unto the death; Perſecutors have taken away the Martyrs lives for Chriſt, but could never deſtroy their love to Chriſt. <hi>Epheſ. 6. 24.

                  <hi>with all that love the Lord Jeſus in ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity,</hi> or, <hi>in incorruption,</hi> as the Greek word ſignifies, whereby the Apoſtle gives us to underſtand, That true love to Chriſt, is not liable to corruption, putrifaction, or decay, but is conſtant and permanent, laſting, yea, everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>That Love that accompanies Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, is like to the Oyl in the Cruſe, and the Meal in the Barrel, that waſted not; it is like the Apple-Tree of <hi>Perſia,</hi> that buddeth, bloſſometh, and beareth fruit every moneth; it is like the Lamp in the ſtory, that never went out; it is like the Stone in <hi>Thra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia,</hi> that neither burneth in the fire, nor

Loves Motto is (<hi>Nulli cedo</hi>) I yeeld to none. Love is like the Sun, the Sun beginning to aſcend in his circle, never goes back until he comes to the higheſt degree there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
               <p>True love abhors Apoſtacie, it aſcends to more perfection, and ceaſes not, until like <hi>Eliahs</hi> Fiery-Chariot, it hath carried the Soul to Heaven.</p>
               <p>Many mens love to Chriſt, is like the Morning Dew, it is like <hi>Jonahs</hi> Goard, that came up in a night, and vaniſhed in a night: But that love that accompanies Salvation, is like <hi>Ruthes</hi> love, a laſting, and an abiding<note place="margin">Ruth 1.</note> love; it is Love that will bed and board with the Soul, that will lye down and riſe up with the Soul, that will to the fire, to the priſon,
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:169968:255"/> to the grave, to Heaven with the Soul.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, That love that accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies Salvation, is an abounding<note place="margin">This is clear throughout the whole Book of <hi>Canti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The very nature of true Love is to abound and riſe higher and higher, <hi>Phil. 1. 9. This I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The longer a Believer lives, the more eminent and excellent Cauſes of Love he ſees in Chriſt. Chriſt diſcovers himſelf gradually to the Soul. Now a Believers love to Chriſt, riſes anſwerable to the cauſes of love that he ſees in Chriſt. The more light, the more love, Knowledge and Love, like the Water and the Ice, beget each other.</p>
               <p>Man loves Chriſt by knowing, and knows Chriſt by loving: Mans love is always anſwerable to his light; he cannot love much, that knows but little; he cannot love little, that knows much. As a man riſes higher

Again, the daily Mercies and Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences that they have of the love of Chriſt, of the care of Chriſt, of the bowels and compaſſions of Chriſt, working more and more towards them, cannot but raiſe their affections more and more to him: As fire is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed by adding of fuel unto it, ſo is our love to Chriſt, upon freſh and new manifeſtations of his great love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us. As the Husband abounds in his love to his Wife, ſo the Wife riſes in her love to her Husband; the more love the Father manifeſts to the Childe, the more the ingenuous Childe riſes in his affections to him; ſo the more love the Lord Jeſus ſhews to us, the more he is beloved by us. Chriſt ſhewed much love to <hi>Mary</hi>

<pb n="459" facs="tcp:169968:256"/> ſweetneſs of Divine love manifeſted to the ſoul, makes the ſoul more ſweet, ſwift, and high in the exerciſe and actings of love towards Chriſt. A Soul under ſpecial manifeſtations of Love, weeps that it can love Chriſt no more. Mr. <hi>Welch,</hi> a <hi>Suffolk</hi> Miniſter, weeping at Table, and being asked the reaſon of it, anſwered, It was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he could love Chriſt no more. The true lovers of Chriſt can never riſe high enough in their love to Chriſt; they count a little love to be no love; great love to be but little; ſtrong love to be but weak; and the higheſt love to be infinitely below the worth of Chriſt, the beauty and glory of Chriſt, the fulneſs, ſweetneſs, and goodneſs of Chriſt: The top of their miſery in this life, is, That they love ſo little, though they are ſo much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved.</p>
               <p>Seventhly and laſtly, That Love that accompanies Salvation, is open love, it is manifeſt love, it is love that cannot be hid, that cannot be covered and buried; it is like the Sun, it will ſhine forth, and ſhew it ſelf to all the world. A man cannot love Chriſt,
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:169968:257"/> but he will ſhew it in theſe, and ſuch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like things as follow.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Divine Love makes the Soul even ready to break, in longing after a further, clearer, and fuller enjoyment of Chriſt. The voice of Divine love is, <hi>Come Lord Jeſus, come quickly.</hi>

               <p>Love deſires and endeavors for ever to be preſent, to converſe with, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy, to be cloſely and eternally united to its object Chriſt.

               </p>

               <p>Thirdly, That love that accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies Salvation, ſometimes ſhews it ſelf by working the Soul to be chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and reſolute, to be patient and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident in ſufferings for Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>

As he is, ſo are we in this world.</hi> Our love anſwers to Chriſts love, and our hatred anſwers to Chriſts hatred; he loves all Righteouſneſs, and hates

The true Lovers of Chriſt reſemble Chriſt to the life, and they put him wholly on. Hence it is, That they are called Chriſts, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 12.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, True love to Chriſt, ſhews it ſelf ſometimes by working the Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of Chriſt, to expoſe themſelves to ſuffering, to ſave Chriſt from ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his glory, to adventure the loſs of their own crowns, to keep Chriſts Crown upon his head, to adventure drowing to ſave Chriſts honor from ſinking.</p>
               <p>Thus did the Three Children, <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel, Moſes,</hi> and other Worthies. I<note place="margin">Heb. 11.</note> have read of a ſervant, who dearly loved his Maſter, and knowing that his Maſter was looked for by his enemies, he put on his Maſters Cloaths, and was taken for his Maſter, and ſuffered death for him. Divine love will make a man do as much for Chriſt, it will make a man hang for Chriſt, and burn for

               <p>Sixthly, That Love that accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies Salvation, ſhews it ſelf ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by working the lovers of Chriſt, to be affected and afflicted with the diſhonors that are done to Chriſt <hi>Pſal. 119.

               <p>The firſt is this, True Love to the Saints is ſpiritual, it is a love for the Image of God, that is ſtamped upon the Soul. <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 8. Epaphras <hi>hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to us your love in the Spirit.</hi> A Soul that truly loves, loves the Father for his own ſake, and the children for the Fathers ſake. Many there are that love Chriſtians for their goods, not for their good; they love them for the money that is in their purſe, but not for the grace that is in their hearts. Many like the <hi>Bohemian</hi> Cur, fawn upon a good ſuit: Love to the Saints, for the Image of God ſtamped upon them, is a flower that grows not in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures Garden.

<pb n="470" facs="tcp:169968:262"/> True love is for what of the Divine Nature, for what of Chriſt and Grace ſhines in a man: It is one thing to love a godly man, and another thing to love him for godlineſs. Many love godly men, as they are Politicians, or Potent, or Learned, or of a ſweet Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but all this is but natural love; but to love them, becauſe they are ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually lovely, becauſe they are <hi>all</hi>

It was not narrow, and confined to ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, but it was univerſal.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, True Love to the Saints, is univerſal to one Chriſtian as well as another, to all as well as any, to poor <hi>Lazarus</hi> as well as to rich <hi>Abraham,</hi> to a deſpiſed <hi>Job</hi> as well as to an admired <hi>David,</hi> to an afflicted <hi>Joſeph</hi> as well as to a raiſed <hi>Jacob,</hi> to a deſpiſed Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple as well as to an exalted Apoſtle. <hi>Phil. 4. 21.

               <p>Thirdly, Our Love to the Saints is<note place="margin">Yet this muſt be granted, That grace in a rugged, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hewn nature, is like a Gold Ring on a le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prous hand, or a Diamond ſet in Iron; As a Gold Ring is moſt pleaſing, and taking, when it is on a neat, clean hand, and as a Diamond when it is ſet in a Ring of Gold; ſo grace is moſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and taking to us in a ſweet nature, and not ſo much when it is in a rugged, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hewn nature; the beauty and glory of it, being clouded and darkned by a rugged nature.</note> right, when we love them, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in them, anſwerable to the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tualcauſes of love that ſhine in them, as the more holy and gracious they are, the more we love them. <hi>Pſal. 16. 2, 3.

Surely, thoſe Chriſtians are under a very great diſtemper of ſpirit, that envy thoſe gifts and graces of God in others, that out-ſhine their own. <hi>Johns</hi> Diſciples muttered and murmured, becauſe Chriſt had more followers and admirers, then <hi>John;</hi> And <hi>Johns</hi> Diſciples are not all dead, yea, they ſeem to have a new Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection in theſe days.

               <p>Ninthly, That Love that accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies Salvation, doth manifeſt and ſhew it ſelf by working the Soul to be quiet, and ſtill under Chriſts rebukes.<note place="margin">John 21. 16, 17, 18</note>

                  <hi>loves, he rebukes;</hi> they can ſee ſmiles thorow Chriſts frowns: They know, that to argue that Chriſt hates them, becauſe he rebukes them, is the Devils Logick; They know, that all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukes of Chriſt, are in order to their internal and eternal good, and that quiets them; They know, that all the rebukes of Chriſt are but fore-runners of ſome glorious manifeſtations of greater love to their ſouls. <hi>Pſal. 71. 20, 21. Thou which haſt ſhewed me great and ſore troubles, ſhalt quicken me again, and ſhalt bring me up again from the depths of the Earth. Thou ſhalt increaſe my greatneſs, and comfort me on every

               <p>Tenthly, That Love that accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies Salvation, ſhews it ſelf by working the heart to be affected and afflicted with the leaſt diſhonors that are done to Chriſt. Love is curious of little things, it is as much afflicted with an idle word, or with an impure dream, as lovers of Chriſt are with adultery or blaſphemy. <hi>David</hi> did but cut off the lap of <hi>Sauls</hi> Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and his heart <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

That which I do, I allow not.</hi> Love will make a man aim at Angelical purity, and perfect innocency; love will be getting up to the top of <hi>Jacobs</hi> Ladder; love can reſt in nothing below perfection: Love
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:169968:267"/> makes a man look more at what he ſhould be, then at what he is; it makes a man ſtrive as for life, to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the higheſt examples, and to write after the choiceſt copies. Love fears<note place="margin">The ſin, and the coat of the ſin, is to be hated, ſaith <hi>Ambroſe.</hi>
                  </note> every Image of offence, it trembles at the appearance of ſin, it doth not, it cannot allow it ſelf to do any thing that looks like ſin, it hates the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſpotted with the fleſh, it ſhuns the occaſions of ſin, as it ſhuns Hell it ſelf: This is the Divine curioſity and glory of a Chriſtians love. Love ſays,<note place="margin">

I have read of a holy man, who out of his love to Chriſt, and hatred of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, would not give one half-penny toward the building of an Idols Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, though he was provoked thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to by intollerable torments. Love<note place="margin">The <hi>Nieene</hi> Fathers would not gratifie <hi>Arrius,</hi> no not in one tittle.</note> knows that the leaſt evils are contrary to the greateſt good, they are contrary to the Nature of Chriſt, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of Chriſt, the Spirit of Chriſt the Grace of Chriſt, the Glory of Chriſt, the Blood of Chriſt. Love knows that little diſhonors (if I may call any ſin little) make way for
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:169968:268"/> greater; as little Theeves unlock the door, and make way for greater. Love knows that little ſins multiplied, become great: As love knows that there is nothing leſſer then a grain of Sand; ſo love knows that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing heavier then the Sand of the Sea, when multiplied.</p>
               <p>Eleventhly, That love that accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies Salvation, will ſhew it ſelf by keeping the doors of the heart ſhut a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe treacherous lovers, that would draw the heart from Chriſt. Love is a Golden Key to let in Chriſt, and a ſtrong lock to keep out others: Though many may knock at Loves door, yet Love will open to none but Chriſt. <hi>Cant. 5. 6. I opened to my Beloved.</hi> &amp; 8. 7. <hi>Many waters cannot quench love, neither can the floods drown it: If a man would give all the ſubſtance of his houſe for love, it would utterly be contemned, (Bon Jabuzu</hi>) contemning it would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned.

<pb n="481" facs="tcp:169968:268"/> out of her love and loyalty to her Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved. It is neither force, nor fraud; it is neither promiſes, nor threatnings; it is neither the Croſs, nor the Crown; the Palace, nor the Priſon; the Rod, nor the Robe; the Hempton Halter, nor the Golden Chain, that will make love embrace a ſtranger in the room of Chriſt. Go, ſays Divine Love, offer your Gold, and empty Glories, to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; your Pleaſures, and your Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures to others; put on your Lyons skin, and fright others: As for my part, I ſcorn, and contemn your golden offers, and I diſdain, and deride your rage and threats. Love makes a man too noble, too high, too gallant, and too faithful, to open, to any lover but Chriſt, to let any lie between the Breſts but Chriſt, <hi>Cant. 1. 13.

Love makes a man cry out, when tempted, Let not any man think
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:169968:269"/> that he will embrace other mens goods to forſake Chriſt, who hath forſaken his own proper goods to follow Chriſt. Love makes a man cry out when tempted, as that worthy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert did, (<hi>Ego non ſum ego) I am not the man that I was.</hi> When my heart was voide of Divine Love, I was as eaſily conquered, as I was tempted: O but now he hath ſhed abroad his love in my ſoul, I am not the man that I was, I had rather die then flie, or fall before a temptation.</p>
               <p>Twelfthly, That Love that accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies Salvation, ſhews it ſelf by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret kindneſſes, by ſecret viſits, by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret expreſſions of love. A Soul that truly loves Chriſt, loves to meet him in a corner, to meet him behinde the door, to meet him in the clefts of the<note place="margin">Cant. 2. 14. Matth. 6. 6.</note> Rock, where no eye ſees, nor no ear hears, nor no heart obſerves. Feigned love is much in commending and kiſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſt upon the ſtage; but unfeign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed love is much in embracing, and weeping over Chriſt in a Cloſet. The Phariſee loved to ſtand praying in the<note place="margin">Matth. 6.</note> Market-place, and in the Temple; but <hi>Nathaniel</hi> was with Chriſt under the<note place="margin">John 1. 48.</note>
                  <pb n="483" facs="tcp:169968:269"/> Fig-tree; and <hi>Cornelius</hi> was at it in the<note place="margin">Acts 10.</note> corner of his houſe; and <hi>Peter</hi> was at it on the Leads; and the Spouſe<note place="margin">Cant. 7. 11.</note> was at it in the Villages. Souls that truly love Chriſt, are much in ſecret viſits, in ſecret prayer, in ſecret ſighing, in ſecret groaning, in ſecret mourning, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> True love is good at bolting of the door, and is always beſt when it is moſt with Chriſt in a corner. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret diſcoveries that Chriſt makes to ſouls, do much oblige them to cloſet ſervices.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arceſilaus,</hi> in <hi>Plutarch,</hi> viſiting his ſick friend, and perceiving his neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that he wanted, and yet his mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty that he was aſhamed to ask, that he might ſatisfie the one, and yet ſalve the other, ſecretly conveyed money under his Pillow; which his friend finding after he was gone, was wont to ſay, <hi>Arceſilaus ſtole this:</hi> So Chriſt ſteals ſecret kindneſſes upon his people, and that draws them out to be much in ſecret, in cloſet ſervices.</p>
               <p>Thirteenthly, That Love that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companies Salvation, ſhews it ſelf by breathing after more clear evidence, and full aſſurance of Chriſts love. To
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:169968:270"/> the ſoul, Divine love would fain have her drop turned into an Ocean, her ſpark into a flame, her penny into a pound, her mite into a million. A ſoul that truly loves, can never ſee e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, nor never taſte enough, nor never feel enough, nor never enjoy e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough of the love of Chriſt; when once they have found his love to be better then Wine, then nothing will ſatisfie them but the kiſſes of his mouth. <hi>Cant. 1. 3. Let him kiſs me with the kiſſes of his mouth.</hi> Not with a kiſs, but with the kiſſes of his mouth. A ſoul once kiſſed by Chriſt, can never have enough of the kiſſes of Chriſt; his lips drop myrrhe, and mercy; no kiſſes to the kiſſes of Chriſt. The<note place="margin">The more a Virgins love is drawn out to another, the more ſhe deſires to be confirmed and aſſured of his love to her.</note> more any ſoul loves Chriſt, the more ſerious, ſtudious, and induſtrious will that ſoul be, to have the love of Chriſt diſcovered, confirmed, witneſſed, and ſealed to it. That is a ſweet word of the Spouſe, <hi>Cant. 8. 6. Set me as a ſeal upon thy heart, as a ſeal upon thy arm; for love is ſtrong as death.</hi> Set me as a ſeal upon thy heart; that is, Let me be deeply engraven as a ſeal into thy heart and affections: Let the love and
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:169968:270"/> remembrance of me, make a deep im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion in thee; and ſet me as a ſeal or ſignet on thy arm.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The ſeal you know is for ratify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, confirming, and making ſure of things. O ſayes the Spouſe, eſtabliſh and confirm me in thy love, and in the outward expreſſions and manifeſtations of it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Seals among the Jews were uſed, not as Ornaments onely, but as Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of love that were continually in ſight and remembrance. O ſays the Church, Let me be ſtill in thy ſight and remembrance, as a monument of thy love. In the Old Law, you know<note place="margin">Exod. 28. 11, 12, 21, 29. compared.</note> the High Prieſt did bear the names of <hi>Iſrael</hi> engraven on ſtones, upon his heart and ſhoulder, for a memorial. Ah ſays the Church, Let my name be deeply engraven upon thy heart; let me be alwayes in thy eye; let me be always a memorial upon thy ſhoulder.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Great men have their ſignets up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their hands in precious eſteem. <hi>Jere. 22. 24.

               <p>Laſtly, That Love that accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies Salvation, ſhews it ſelf by working a true lover of Chriſt, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit his richeſt Treaſures, his choiceſt Jewels, to the care and cuſtody of Chriſt.

Caeſar</hi> received not his wounds from the ſwords of enemies, but from the hands of friends; that is, from truſting in them. Oh! but the lovers of Chriſt ſhall never receive any wounds, by truſting in Chriſt, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting their choiceſt Jewels to his care; for he hath a powerful hand,
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:169968:271"/> and a wiſe and loving heart. Chriſt will hold faſt whatever the Father, or the Saints put into his hand. And thus I have ſhewed you what that Love is, that doth accompany Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. I come now in the ſixth place to ſhew you, what Prayer that is that doth accompany Salvation. (But I ſee that I muſt contract what remains into a narrow room, leſt I ſhould tire out both the Reader and my ſelf. Which that I may not, I ſhall endeavor by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Aſſiſtance, to minde brevity in what remains.)</p>
               <p>Now that Prayer doth accompany Salvation, I have formerly ſhewed. Now I am briefly to ſhew you what Prayer that is that doth accompany Salvation, and that I ſhall do in theſe following particulars.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Prayer is a Divine Worſhip,<note place="margin">The matter of Prayer may be reduced to theſe heads, 1. Petition. 2. Deprecation. 3. Interceſſion 4. Expoſtulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. There are other diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in regard of the manner, As firſt, Mental Prayer, which is the inward lifting up of the heart to God. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Vocal, which is uttered by words, As the Publicans, <hi>God be merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to me a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</hi> Thirdly, There is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived prayer, and preſcribed prayer. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, There is publick or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate prayer. Theſe hints may ſuffice as to this.</note> wherein we ſpeak to God in Faith, Humility, Sincerity, and Fervency of Spirit, through the Mediation of Chriſt, begging thoſe good things that we and others want, deprecating that we and others fear, and giving thanks for that we and others have received. Prayer is a ſpeaking to God face to
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:169968:272"/> face; it is <hi>Iacobs</hi> Ladder, by which the ſoul climbs up to Heaven; it is <hi>Noahs</hi> Dove, that goes, and returns not till it brings Aſſurance of Peace.</p>
               <p>But not to pleaſe you with notions, you muſt remember that that Prayer that accompanies Salvation, is ſuch Prayer as hath in it all the requiſites of Prayer. Now there are four re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſites in Prayer.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The perſon muſt be righteous, <hi>Iam. 5. 16. The fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much.</hi> John 9. 31. <hi>God heareth not ſinners.</hi> The Jews urge it as a Proverb, An unclean per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon polluteth his own Prayers. Good motions from a bad heart, make no muſick in Heaven; the ſweet words that drop from a Lepers lips, are but lies in the account of God. <hi>Hoſea</hi> 11. 12.</p>
               <p>I have read of a Jewel, that being put in a dead mans mouth, loſeth all its vertue: Prayer in the mouth of a wicked man that is dead God-wards, Chriſt-wards, Heaven-wards, and Holineſs-wards, is a Jewel that loſeth all its vertue. <hi>Pſal. 50. 16, 17. But un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the wicked, God ſaith, What haſt thou
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:169968:272"/> to do to declare my Statutes; or that thou</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Quid prodeſt voce invocare, quem operibus negas?</hi> Jerom. <hi>What availeth it to invocate him with thy voice, whom thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieſt in thy works?</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>ſhouldeſt take my Covenant into thy mouth? Seeing that thou hateſt inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and caſteſt my words behinde thee. Bias,</hi> an Heathen, being at Sea in a great ſtorm, and perceiving many wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed wretches with him in the ſhip, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling upon the gods, <hi>O,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear Prayer, hold your tongues, I would not have the gods take notice that you are here, they will ſure drown us all, if they ſhould.</hi> You are wiſe, and know how to apply it.</p>
               <p>The ſecond requiſite in Prayer, is<note place="margin">It was both a prophane and blaſphemous Speech of that Atheiſtical wretch, that told God he was no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon beggar, he never troubled him before with prayer, and if he would hear him that time, he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver trouble him again. <hi>Heil. Mic p. 376.</hi>
                  </note> this, <hi>viz.</hi> The matter of your Prayer muſt be good, 1 <hi>John 5. 14. And this is the confidence that we have in him, That if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us.</hi> The Favorits of Heaven have no further the ear of the King of Kings in Prayer, then the matter of their Prayer is good, and <hi>agreeable to his will, Rom.</hi> 8. 27. The matter of your Prayer muſt fall under ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, or general precept, or promiſe, or elſe God will never own it, nor honor it with acceptance. You muſt not pray as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> prayed before his Converſion, he prayed for conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:169968:273"/> with a Proviſo, <hi>Lord give me con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinency</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>but not yet.</hi> Such Hypocriſie is double Iniquity, and God will deal with ſuch ſinners ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, As the matter of your Prayer muſt be good, ſo the manner of your Prayer muſt be right. God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards not ſo much the matter, as the manner of our Prayer; God loves Adverbs, better then Nowns; not to<note place="margin">Criton.</note> pray onely, but to pray well; (<hi>Non bonum, ſed benè agere</hi>) not to do good, but to do it well.</p>
               <p>Now for the better and further clearing of this truth, I ſhall ſhew you, by Divine Aſſiſtance, what it is to pray in a right manner; and that I ſhall do in the following particulars.</p>
               <p>Firſt, To pray in a right manner, is to pray underſtandingly, to pray knowingly, 1 <hi>Cor. 14. 15. I will pray with underſtanding.</hi> He that doth not pray underſtandingly, doth not pray, but prate; as that Parrot in <hi>Rome,</hi> that could diſtinctly ſay over the whole<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ignorat ſanè im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probus omnis,</hi> ſaith <hi>Ariſtotle.</hi> Ignorance is the ſource of all ſin, the very well-ſpring from which all wickedneſs doth iſſue.</note> Creed. <hi>John 4. 22. Ye worſhip ye know not what</hi> (ſayes Chriſt.) So many pray they know not what. Without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:169968:273"/> the minde cannot be good, <hi>Prov.</hi> 19. And can the Prayer be good, when the minde is bad? A blinde minde, a blinde Sacrifice, and a blinde Prieſt, are abominable to God. It was a good ſaying of one, <hi>God heareth not the words of one that prayeth,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>unleſs he that prayeth, heareth them firſt himſelf:</hi> And verily, God will never underſtand that Prayer, that we do not underſtand our ſelves.</p>
               <p>Secondly, To pray in a right manner, is to pray believingly, <hi>Heb. 11. 6. He</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher could ſay, <hi>Qui timi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>è ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat, docet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gare,</hi> He that craveth fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, draweth on a denial.</note> 
                  <hi>that cometh unto God, muſt believe that he is;</hi> that is, that he is really, as good, as gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, as glorious, as excellent, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as his word reports him to be. And that he is <hi>a rewarder of them that diligently ſeek him.</hi> Mark 11. 24. <hi>Therefore I ſay unto you, what things ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ye deſire when ye pray, believe that ye</hi>
                  <note place="margin">One of the Ancients de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes Prayer thus; It is (ſaith he) <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſus mentis ad Deum,</hi> a climb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of the heart to God, which cannot be done, but by the power of Faith.</note> 
                  <hi>receive them, and ye ſhall have them.</hi> In the Greek it is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in the Preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſe, <hi>Ye do receive them,</hi> to ſhew the certainty of receiving them: You ſhall as certainly receive the good things that believingly you ask in Prayer, as if you had them already in your hand. God will never let the hand
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:169968:274"/> of Faith go empty away in Prayer: Faith is Gods darling, and he never fails to give it a worthy portion, a <hi>Benjamins</hi> portion, a <hi>Hannahs</hi> portion, a double portion, <hi>Iam. 1. 5, 6, 7. If any of you lack wiſdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it ſhall be given him. But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering; for he that wavereth, is like</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Unbelief is virtually all ill, therefore fight eſpecially againſt it.</note> 
                  <hi>a wave of the Sea, driven with the wind, and toſſed. For let not that man think, that he ſhall receive any thing of the Lord.</hi> He that prayeth doubtingly, ſhuts the Gates of Heaven againſt his own Prayers.</p>
               <p>It is reported in the life of <hi>Luther,</hi> that when he prayed, it was (<hi>Tanta reverentia ut ſi Deo, &amp; tanta fiducia ut ſi amico</hi>) with ſo much reverence, as if he were praying to God; and with ſo much boldneſs, as if he had been ſpeaking to his friend. Faith in Prayer, makes a man divinely familiar, and bold with God in Prayer. That Prayer that hath not the image and ſtamp of Faith upon it, is no Prayer in Divine account. The ſweeteſt flowers of Paradiſe, are onely acceptable to
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:169968:274"/> God, as they are tendered to him by a hand of Faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> when a poor man came to preſent a Petition to him, with his hand ſhaking and trembling out of fear, the Emperor was much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed, and ſaid, <hi>It is not fit that any ſhould come with a Petition to a King, as if a man were giving meat to an Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant,</hi> that is, afraid to be deſtroyed by him.</p>
               <p>Verily, <hi>Iehovah</hi> loves to ſee every one of his Petitioners to come to him with a ſtedfaſt Faith, and not with a trembling Hand. Chriſt gets moſt glory, and the Soul gets moſt good, by thoſe Prayers that are accompanied with the actings of Faith.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, To pray in a right manner, is to pray intenſly, ſervently, earneſtly. So <hi>Jam. 5. 16. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, Faith is an om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niporent grace, it works won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, in the Heart, and in Earth, Such working-prayer as ſets all the faculties of the ſoul, and all the graces in the ſoul at work, alwayes ſpeeds; it fails not of win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the day, of carrying the Crown.</note> or as the Greek hath it, <hi>The working Prayer;</hi> that is, ſuch Prayer as ſets the whole man a work; the word ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies, ſuch a working as notes the live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt activity that can be. As Phyſick kills the body, if it work not; ſo doth
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:169968:275"/> Prayer the ſoul, if it be not a work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-prayer. As a painted fire is no fire, a dead man no man; ſo a cold prayer is no prayer: In a painted fire there is no heat, in a dead man there is no life; ſo in a cold prayer there is no omnipotency, no devotion, no bleſſing. It is not cold, but working<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prayer, that can lock up Heaven three years, and open Heavens gate at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and bring down the ſweeteſt bleſſings upon our heads, and the choiceſt favors into our hearts. Cold Prayers are as Arrows without heads, as Swords without edges, as Birds without wings, they peirce not, they cut not, they flie not up to Heaven: Cold Prayers do always freeze before they reach to Heaven. So <hi>Jacob</hi> was earneſt in his wreſtling with God. <hi>Let</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 32. 24, 25, 26, 27.</note> 
                  <hi>me alone,</hi> ſayes God: <hi>I will not let thee go, except thou bleſs me,</hi> ſayes <hi>Jacob. Jacob,</hi> though lamed, and hard laid at, will not let the Lord go without a bleſſing: <hi>Jacob</hi> holds with his hands, when his joynts were out of joynt; and ſo as a Prince prevails with God. <hi>Jacob</hi> prayes and weeps, and weeps<note place="margin">The Jews have a ſaying, That ſince the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the door of prayers hath been ſhut: But the door of tears was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſhut, ſaith One.</note> and prayes, and ſo prevails with God.

An importunate ſoul will never ceaſe till he ſpeed, he will devour all diſcouragements, yea, he will turn diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements into incouragements, as the woman of <hi>Canaan</hi> did, till Chriſt ſayes, <hi>Be it unto thee,</hi> O Soul, <hi>as thou wilt.</hi>

You know how to apply it.</note> doeſt thou think that <hi>Ionah</hi> prayed thus, when he was in the belly of Hell? or <hi>Daniel,</hi> when he was in the Lyons den? or the Thief when he was upon the croſs? And I may adde, or the three Children when they were in the fiery furnace? or the Apoſtles when they were in bonds and priſons?

An importunate Soul in Prayer, is like the poor begger, that prayes and knocks, that prayes and waits, that prayes and works, that knocks and knits, that begs and patches, and will not ſtir from the door, till he hath an alms. And verily, he that is good at

               <p>One reports of <hi>Joachim,</hi> the Father
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:169968:278"/> of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> that he would often ſay (<hi>Cibus &amp; potus mihi erit oratio,</hi>) Prayer is my meat and drink. Ah Chriſtians, the more ſincere you are, the more will Prayer be your meat and drink; and the more prayer is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and pleaſure to you, the more will you be the pleaſure and delight of God, who delights in thoſe that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in his ſervice, and that count his work better then wages.

The chiefeſt end, the white, the
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:169968:279"/> mark, at which the ſoul muſt aim in Prayer, is Gods glory. <hi>Whatſoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.</hi> When God crowns us, he doth but crown his own gifts in us; and when we give God the glory of all we do, we do but give him the glory that is due unto his Name: For he works all our works in us, and for us.

               <pb n="503" facs="tcp:169968:279"/>
               <p>Ah Chriſtians, it is not a flood of words, nor high ſtrains of wit, nor vehemency of affections in Prayer, but holy and gracious ends that will ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Prayer acceptable and honorable to God, comfortable and profitable to your ſelves, and others; yea, the directing of one Prayer to divine glory, doth more torture and torment Satan, then all the Prayers in the world that are directed to ends below divine glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. It is not ſimply Prayer, but the ſouls aiming at divine glory in Prayer, that addes to Chriſts Crown, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans Hell.</p>
               <p>And thus I have ſhewed you all the Requiſits of Prayer, even of ſuch Prayer as accompanies Salvation. I ſhall now proceed to ſome other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, for the further and fuller open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this truth.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That Prayer that accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies<note place="margin">It was a ſweet ſaying of one, <hi>O Lord, I never come to thee, but by thee; I never go from thee, without thee.</hi>
                  </note> Salvation, betters the whole Man; by it Faith is increaſed, Hope ſtrengthned, the Spirit exhilarated, the Heart pacified, the Conſcience purified, Temptations vanquiſhed, Corruptions weakned, the Affections inflamed, the Will more renewed, and the whole
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:169968:280"/> Man more advantaged. Prayer is a Spiritual Chair, wherein the ſoul ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth down at the feet of the Lord, to receive the influences of his Grace: Prayer is the Regal Gate, by which the Lord entereth into the heart, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting, quieting, ſtrengthning, quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and raiſing of it. The Scripture affords us a cloud of witneſſes to prove this truth, but I appeal to praying Saints, Ah tell me, tell me, praying Souls, have not you, do not you finde it ſo? I know you have and do, and that is it that makes Prayer a pleaſure, a paradiſe unto you.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, You may judge what Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er that is that accompanies Salvation, by conſidering the difference that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Prayers of the godly and the wicked.

               <p>Firſt, Gracious Souls do trade and deal with God in Prayer onely upon the account and credit of Chriſt.

They ſeek the Father in the Son, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent their ſutes always in Chriſts Name; for ſo is the will of Chriſt, <hi>John 14. 13, 14. And whatſoever ye ſhall ask in my Name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. If ye ſhall ask any thing in my Name, I will do it.</hi> John 15. 16. <hi>Whatſoever ye ſhall ask of the Father in my Name, he will give it you.</hi> Chap. 16. 23. <hi>Verily I ſay unto you, whatſoever ye ſhall ask the Father in my Name, he will give it you.</hi>

<pb n="506" facs="tcp:169968:281"/> to the cuſtom of Princes, to whom there is no paſſage, unleſs we be brought in by one of their Favorites. <hi>Plutarch</hi> reports, That it was wont to be the way of ſome of the Heathens, the <hi>Moloſsians,</hi> when they would ſeek the favor of their Prince, they took up the Kings Son in their Arms, and ſo went and kneeled before the King. Ah Chriſtians, Chriſt is near and dear unto the Father, the Father hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to give out all his loves and favors through his Son; if you bring<note place="margin">As <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaid, <hi>See not my face, except you bring</hi> Benjamin <hi>with you:</hi> So ſayes God, See not my face, except you bring Jeſus with you. Gen. 42. 20, to 34. And as <hi>David</hi> ſaid to <hi>Abner.</hi> 2 Sam. 3. 13.</note> Chriſt in the arms of your Faith, you gain the Fathers heart, and in gaining his heart, you gain all. The Fathers Mercies melt, his Bowels roul, his Heart turns, his Compaſſions are kindled, upon the ſight of his Sons Merits and Mediation. As <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſaid to his Brethren, <hi>Ye ſhall not ſee my face, unleſs you bring your Brother</hi> Benjamin: So ſayes God, you ſhall not ſee my face unleſs you bring the Lord Jeſus with you.</p>
               <p>Now gracious Souls, in all their Prayers, they preſent Jeſus Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Father, and upon his account they deſire thoſe things that make for
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:169968:281"/> their external, internal, and eternal good. Ah but vain men treat and trade with God in Prayer, upon the account of their own worth, righteouſneſs, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs, and ſervices, <hi>Iſa. 58. 2, 3. Yet they ſeek me daily, and delight to know my ways, as a Nation that did Righteouſneſs, and forſook not the Ordinance of their God. They ask of me the Ordinances of Juſtice, they take delight in approaching to me: Wherefore have we faſted, ſay they, and thou ſeeſt not? Wherefore have we afflicted our ſouls, and thou takeſt no knowledge?</hi> Here you ſee they ſtand upon their own practiſes, and ſervices, and expoſtulate the caſe with God in an angry manner, becauſe God did not anſwer their hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocritical performances. So the proud Phariſee ſtands in Prayer upon his own worthineſs, and righteouſneſs, <hi>Luk. 18. 11, 12. The Phariſee ſtood and prayed</hi>
                  <note place="margin">This Phariſee was like the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, painted without, and ſpotted within, varniſh with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min within.</note> 
                  <hi>thus with himſelf, God, I thank thee, that I am not as other men are, extortioners, unjuſt, adulterers, or even as this Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can. I faſt twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I poſſeſs.</hi> So did thoſe Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites in the ſixth Chapter, and in the three and twentieth Chapter of <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew,</hi> ſtand very much upon their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:169968:282"/> ſervices and performances, though they were but ſhining ſins, but filthy rags.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Souls truly gracious, pray more to get off their ſins, then they do to get off their chains. Though Bonds did attend <hi>Paul</hi> in every place, as<note place="margin">Acts 20. 23.</note> himſelf ſpeaks, yet he never cries out, O wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from my Bonds, but <hi>O</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 7. 23.</note> 
                  <hi>wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me,</hi> from my ſins, <hi>from this body of death? David</hi> cryes not, <hi>Perii,</hi> but <hi>Peccavi,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 51.</note> Not I am undone, but I have done fooliſhly: But wicked men ſtrive in Prayer, more to get off their chains, then to get off their ſins, more to be delivered from enemies without, then luſts within, more to get out of the Furnace, then to be delivered from their Spiritual Bondage; as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures<note place="margin">Pſal. 78. 34. Zach. 7. 5, 6, 7. Iſai. 26. 16, 17.</note> in the Margent do evidence.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The Stream and Cream of a gracious Mans ſpirit, runs moſt out in Prayer, after Spiritual and Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly<note place="margin">Pſal. 4. 6, 7. &amp; 27 4.</note> things, as is abundantly evident by thoſe Prayers of the Saints that are upon record throughout the Scripture: But the Stream and Cream of vain
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:169968:282"/> mens ſpirits in Prayer runs moſt out after poor, low, carnal things, as you may ſee in comparing the following Scriptures together, <hi>Hoſ. 7. 14. Zach. 7. 5, 6, 7. Jam. 4. 3, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, A gracious Soul looks and lives more upon God in Prayer, then upon his Prayer: He knows, though Prayer be his Chariot, yet Chriſt is his food: Prayer may be a ſtaff to ſupport him, but Chriſt is that Manna that muſt nouriſh him; and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him he looks, and lives. <hi>Pſal. 5. 3.

Wicked men think it is Religion enough for them to pray, and to look after their prayers, to ſee how their prayers ſpeed
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:169968:283"/> is no Article of their Faith: But a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Soul is of a more noble ſpirit, when he hath prayed he will ſtand upon his watch-tower, and obſerve what God will ſpeak. <hi>Pſal. 85. 8. I will hear that God the Lord will ſpeak; for he will ſpeak peace unto his people, and to his Saints: But let them not return to folly;</hi> or as the Hebrew may be read, <hi>And they ſhall</hi>

               <p>Fifthly, No diſcouragements can take gracious Souls off from Prayer, but the leaſt diſcouragements will<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> though a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, could ſay, <hi>That in ſome caſes a man had better loſe his life, then be cowardly.</hi> Ethic. 3. c. 1.</note> take off carnal hearts from Prayer, as you may ſee in the following Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, compared together, <hi>Pſal. 40. 1, 2. &amp; 44. 10-23. Matth. 15. 21-29. Mal. 3. 14. Iſai. 58. 1, 2, 3. Amos 8. 3, 4, 5, &amp;c.</hi> When one of the Ancient Martyrs was terrified with the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of his perſecutors, he replied,
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:169968:283"/> 
                  <hi>There is nothing</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>of things viſible, nothing of things inviſible, that I fear, I will ſtand to my profeſsion of the name of Chriſt, and contend earneſtly for the Faith once delivered to the Saints, come on it what will.</hi> It is neither the hope of life, nor the fear of death, that can take a real Chriſtian off from Prayer: He is rather raiſed then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected; he is rather quickned then diſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>couraged by delays or denials; he will hold up and hold on in a way and courſe of Prayer, though men ſhould rage, and Lyons roar, and the Furnace be heat ſeven times hotter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But it is not ſo with carnal hearts, <hi>Job</hi> 27 9, 10.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, When a gracious man<note place="margin">In his courſe his heart is in his Prayer, he findes by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience that the heart is the <hi>Primum mobile,</hi> the great wheel that moves all other wheels. It is the chief Monarch in the Iſle of Man.</note> prayes; he hath his heart in his Prayer, when he falls upon the work he makes heart-work on it. So <hi>David</hi> in <hi>Pſal. 42. 4. When I remember theſe things, I pour out my heart.</hi> So <hi>Hannah</hi> in 1 Sam. 1. 15. <hi>I am a woman of a ſorrowful ſpirit</hi> (ſaith ſhe) <hi>and have poured out my ſoul before the Lord.</hi> So the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in 1 <hi>Sam. 7. 6.

                  </note> that no Prayer is acknowledged, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, and rewarded by God, but that wherein the heart is ſincerely and wholly. It is not a piece, it is not a corner of the heart, that will ſatisfie the Maker of the heart. The true Mother would not have the childe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided: As God loves a broken and a contrite heart, ſo he loaths a divided heart.

               <p>Now wicked men are heartleſs in all their Services<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in all their Prayers, as you may ſee in comparing the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Scriptures together, (I ſhall not

It is not the lifting up of the voice, nor the wringing of the hands, nor the beating of the breſts, but the ſtirrings of the heart, that God looks at in Prayer. God hears no more then the heart ſpeaks; if the heart be dumb, God will certainly be deaf. No Prayer takes with God, but that which is the travel of the heart.</p>

When they pray, they look with a curious eye upon their own ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, they look with a narrow eye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their own hearts, and obſerve how they are affected, melted, humbled, quickned, raiſed, ſpiritualized, and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by Prayer: But vain men as they pray to <hi>be ſeen of men;</hi> ſo they eye moſt how others like their prayers, and<note place="margin">Matth. 6. &amp; 23.

               <p>And thus I have endeavored to ſhew you what a wide difference there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Prayers of the godly, and the ungodly; and by this, as by the former particulars laid down, you may ſee what Prayer that is that accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies Salvation.</p>
               <p>Now, in the ſeventh place, I ſhall<note place="margin">The ſeventh thing that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companies Salvation, is Perſeverance.</note> ſhew you what Perſeverance that is that accompanies Salvation, and that I ſhall do in theſe following parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That Perſeverance that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companies Salvation, is, Perſeverance in a holy Profeſſion. <hi>Heb. 4. 14. Seeing then that we have a great High Prieſt, that is paſſed into the Heavens, Jeſus the Son of God: Let us hold faſt our profeſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by a ſtrong hand,</hi> or by a hand <hi>of holy</hi>

                     </gap>, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies, A forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble holding, a holding with both hands. <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>.</note> 
                  <hi>wavering</hi> (or as it is in the Greek, <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out tilting,</hi> or <hi>toſsing to one ſide or other) for he is faithful that promiſed.</hi> Therefore let no temptation, affliction, oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or perſecution, take us off from our holy Profeſſion, but let us hold
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:169968:286"/> our Profeſſion with a forcible hand, yea, with both hands, in the face of all difficulties, dangers, and deaths. As <hi>Cynaegirus,</hi> the <hi>Athenian</hi> Captain, did the ſhip that was laden with the rich ſpoil of his Country.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That Perſeverance that accompanies Salvation, is, a Perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in holy and ſpiritual Principles: It is an abiding in love, <hi>John</hi> 15. 9, 10.<note place="margin">So in Col. 1. 23. 1 Tim. 2. 15. Heb. 13. 1. &amp; 11. 13. Theſe all died in Faith; or as it is in the Greek, They all died <hi>accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Faith;</hi> that is, Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering in Faith.</note> And an abiding in faith and hope, 1 <hi>Cor. 13. 13, &amp;c.</hi> Perſeverence is not a particular diſtinct Grace of it ſelf; but ſuch a Vertue as crowns all vertue; it is ſuch a Grace as caſts a general glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and beauty upon every grace: It is a Grace that leads every grace on to perfection.</p>
               <p>To perſevere in holy and heavenly Principles, is, To perſevere in Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, in Repenting, in Mourning, in Hoping; It is to perſevere in Love, in Fear, in Humility, in Patience, in Self-denial, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now it is this perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance<note place="margin">It is a Rule in the Civil Law (<hi>Nec videtur actum ſi quid ſuperfit quod agatur</hi>) that nothing ſeems to be done, if there remain ought to be done. Let a man do never ſo much, if he do not perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere, he will be found to have done nothing.</note> in holy and gracious Principles that accompaines Salvation, that leads to Salvation. No grace, no, not the moſt ſparkling and ſhining grace, can bring a man to Heaven of it ſelf, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:169968:287"/> Perſeverance; not Faith, which is the Champion of Grace, if it faint and fail; not Love, which is the Nurſe of Grace, if it decline and wax cold; not Humility, which is the adorner &amp; beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifier of Grace, if it continue not to the end; not Obedience, not Repentance, not Patience, nor no other Grace, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they have their perfect work. It is Perſeverance in Grace that crowns every Grace, and every gracious Soul with a crown of glory at laſt. <hi>Revel. 2. 10. Be thou faithful to the death, and I will give thee a crown of life.</hi> Such as<note place="margin">As all Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites onely do. John 6, &amp;c.</note> onely believe for a time, and repent for a time, and love for a time, and repent for a time, and love for a time, and rejoyce for a time, and hope for a time, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But do not perſevere and hold out, will be doubly miſerable in the day of ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance. Perſeverance is the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of every Grace, without it, he that fights cannot hope to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come; and he that for the preſent doth overcome, cannot look for the Crown, unleſs he ſtill perſeveres and goes on conquering, and to conquer, till he findes all his enemies ſlain before him.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That Perſeverance that
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:169968:287"/> accompanies Salvation, is, An abiding<note place="margin">You muſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere and hold faſt the faith of the Goſpel, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out wavering in it, or ſtart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling from it. You muſt be as the Center, or as Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> ſtedfaſt and unmove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</note> or continuing in the Word or Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Chriſt. <hi>John 15. 7. If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye ſhall ask what you will, and it ſhall be done un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you.</hi> 1 John 2. 14. <hi>I have written un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you yong men, becauſe ye are ſtrong, and the Word of God abideth in you.</hi> Verſ. 24. <hi>Let that therefore abide in you, which you have heard from the beginning; if that which ye have heard from the beginning, ſhall remain in you, ye alſo ſhall continue in the Son, and in the Father.</hi> 2 John verſ. 9. <hi>Whoſoever tranfgreſſeth and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bideth not in the Doctrine of Christ, hath not God. He that abideth in the Doctrine of Christ, he hath both the Father, and the Son.</hi> None ſhall receive the end of<note place="margin">The Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle was cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over with red (and the purple feathers tell us, that they take that habit for the ſame intent) to note, That we muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the tru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

If ye continue in my Word, then are ye my Diſciples indeed.</hi> It is the End that crowns the action, as the Evening crowns the day, as the laſt act com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends the whole Scene. It is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to begin well, except we end well; the beginning of Chriſtians is
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:169968:288"/> not ſo conſiderable as the end. <hi>Manaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeh</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> began ill, but ended well;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Neroes</hi> firſt five years were fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards who more cruel?</note> 
                  <hi>Judas</hi> and <hi>Demas</hi> began well, but end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ill. It is not the knowledge of the Doctrine of Chriſt, nor the commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Word of Chriſt, but the abiding in Chriſts Word, the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Chriſts Doctrine, that accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies Life and Glory, and that will render a man happy at laſt. Such that with <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>Alexander,</hi> put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 1. 19, 20. 1 Cor. 5. 5.</note> or make ſhipwrack of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Faith, of the Word of Faith, ſhall by the Lord, or his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or by both, be delivered unto Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, that they may learn not to blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme: Uſually the end of ſuch, is worſe then the beginning. Double<note place="margin">2 Pet. 2. 20, 21, 22. 2 Tim 3. 13.</note> damnation attends thoſe that begin in the Spirit, and end in the Fleſh.</p>
               <p>Fourthly and laſtly, That Perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance that accompanies Salvation, is, A Perſeverance in holy and gracius<note place="margin">Phil. 3. 10-14 Iſa. 40. ult.</note> Actions and Motions, it is a continuing in Pious Duties, and Religious Services. The life of Chriſtian conſiſts in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,<note place="margin">

<pb n="521" facs="tcp:169968:288"/> ſtill, he muſt alwayes be a going on from Faith to Faith, and from ſtrength to ſtrength. When Saints have done their work in this life, they ſhall ſit upon Thrones in a better life.

                     </gap>, ſignifying a continuance in Prayer and Supplication, with an invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible and ſtrong con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy. There was a Temple of <hi>Concord</hi> among the Heathens, and ſhall it not be found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans that are the Temple of the Holy Ghoſt?</note> is a going on, a holding out, in ways of piety and ſanctity. <hi>Acts 1. 14. Theſe all continued with one accord in Prayer and Supplication.</hi> Chap. 2. 42. <hi>And they continued ſtedfaſtly in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles Doctrine and Fellowſhip, and in breaking of Bread, and in Prayers.</hi> Verſ. 46. <hi>And they continued daily with one accord in the Temple, and breaking Bread from houſe to houſe, did eat their meat with gladneſs, and ſingleneſs of heart.</hi> 1 Tim. 5. 5. <hi>Now ſhe that is a widow indeed, and deſolate, truſteth in God, and continueth in Supplications and Prayers, night and day.</hi> Rom. 12. 12. <hi>Continuing inſtant in Prayer.</hi> Chriſtians muſt work hard in a Wilderneſs, before they ſit down in paradiſe: They muſt make a conſtant progreſs in holineſs, before they enter into happineſs.</p>
               <p>It is the excellency of Perſeverance, that it keeps a Chriſtian ſtill in motion God-wards, Heaven-wards, Holineſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. It is a Grace that quickens a
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:169968:289"/> man to motion, to action; it keeps a man ſtill going, ſtill doing. And Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is the excellency of the Creature, and the more excellent any Creature is, the more excellent is that Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in its motions; as you may ſee in the motions of the Celeſtial Bodies, the Sun, Moon, and Stars. Perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is a perpetual motion in ways of Grace and Holineſs. Perſeverance will<note place="margin">Pſal. 44. 16, 17, 18, 19, 20.</note> make a man hold up, and hold on, in the work and ways of the Lord, in the face of all impediments, diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, temptations, tribulations, and perſecutions. As the Moon holds on her motion, though the dogs bark; ſo Perſeverance will make a Chriſtian hold on in his holy and heavenly Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, though vain men bark, and bite, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus I have ſhewed you what Perſeverance that is that accompanies Salvation.</p>

Firſt, I call it a Grace of God, becauſe he is the donor of it; and therefore he is called the God of Hope, <hi>Rom. 15. 13. Now the God of Hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing.</hi> Now God is called the God of Hope, becauſe he is <hi>objectivè,</hi> the onely object of our Hope, and he is <hi>effectivè,</hi> the onely Author and Worker of Hope in the Soul. Hope is no natural affection in men, men are not born with hope in their hearts, as they are born with tongues in their mouthes: Hope is nobly deſcended, it is from above, it is a heavenly Babe, that is formed in the ſoul of man by the power of the Holy Ghoſt. And as Hope is no natural affection, ſo Hope is no Moral vertue, which men may attain by their frequent actions; but Hope is a Theological vertue that none can give but God. Secondly, I ſay it is a Grace of God, whereby we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect good to come; I ſay good, not evil; for evil is rather feared, then hoped for by any. The object of this Hope hath four conditions. 1. It muſt
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:169968:290"/> be <hi>Bonum,</hi> good. 2. <hi>Futurum,</hi> future. 3. <hi>Poſsibile,</hi> poſſible. 4. <hi>Arduum,</hi> hard or difficult to obtain. Thirdly, I ſay Hope is a Grace of God, whereby we expect good to come, patiently wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing till it come: Hope makes the Soul quiet and patient till it comes to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs the good deſired and hoped for, <hi>Rom. 8. 25. But if we hope for that we ſee not, then do we with patience wait for it.</hi> The Hebrew word (<hi>Kavah</hi>) that is often tranſlated Hope, ſignifies a very vehement intention, both of body and minde, a ſtretching forth of the Spirit or Minde, in waiting for a deſired good.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4. ult. Hope fates well, it keeps a Princes Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, it lives up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Honey and Milk, Oyl and Wine, it ſives upon the ſweet meats, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licates of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, as God, Chriſt, and Glory. Pſal. 31. 24. &amp; 33. 22. &amp; 38. 15. &amp; 42. 5. &amp; 43. 5. &amp; 39. 7. &amp; 71. 5. &amp; 65. 5.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, That Hope that accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies Salvation, is alwayes conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant about holy and heavenly objects, as about God and Chriſt. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 1. Paul <hi>an Apoſtle of Jeſus Chriſt by the commandment of God our Saviour, and Lord Jeſus Christ, which is our Hope.</hi> In theſe words, Chriſt is ſet forth as the chief object of our Hope, becauſe by his merits and mercy, we hope to obtain the remiſſion of our ſins, and the eternal Salvation of our ſouls. Sometimes Hope is exerciſed about
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:169968:291"/> the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt. <hi>Gal. 5. 5. For we through the Spirit, wait for the Hope of Righteouſneſs by Faith.</hi> Sometimes Hope is exerciſed about God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, 1 <hi>Pet. 1. 21. Who by him do believe in God, that raiſed him up from the dead, and gave him glory, that your faith and hope might be in God.</hi> Jere. 14. 8. <hi>O the Hope of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>the Saviour thereof in time of trouble.</hi> Chap. 17. 13. <hi>O Lord, the hope of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>all that forſake thee ſhall be aſhamed.</hi> Verſ. 17. <hi>Thou art my hope in the day of evil.</hi> Sometimes Hope<note place="margin">The Jewiſh Rabbins were wont to ſay, That upon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Letter of the Law, there hangs Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able matter. Ah then what abundance of comfort and ſweetneſs may hope finde, yea, does hope finde in the Promiſes?</note> is exerciſed, and buſied about the Word and Promiſes, <hi>Pſal. 119. 49. Remember the word unto thy ſervant, upon which thou haſt cauſed me to Hope.</hi> Verſ. 81. <hi>My ſoul fainteth for thy Salvation, but I hope in thy Word.</hi> Verſe 114. <hi>Thou art my hiding place, and my ſhield. I hope in thy Word.</hi> Pſal. 130. 5. <hi>I wait for the Lord, my ſoul doth wait: And in his Word, do I hope.</hi> Pſal. 119. 74. <hi>They that fear thee will be glad, when they ſee me: Becauſe I have hoped in thy Word.</hi> Verſe 147. <hi>I prevented the dawning of the morning, and cryed: I hoped in thy Word.</hi> Hope in the Promiſe, will keep the head from aking, and the heart
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:169968:291"/> from breaking, it will keep both head and heart from ſinking and drowning. Hope exerciſed upon the promiſe, brings Heaven down to the heart: The Promiſes are the Ladder by which Hope gets up to Heaven. Hope in the Promiſe will not onely keep life and ſoul together, but it will alſo keep the ſoul and glory together. Hope in<note place="margin">Pſal. 4<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Hol. 6. 1, 2.</note> the Promiſe will ſupport diſtreſſed ſouls; Hope in the Promiſe will ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle perplexed ſouls; Hope in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe will comfort dejected ſouls; Hope in the Promiſe will reduce wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering ſouls; Hope in the Promiſe will confirm ſtaggering ſouls; Hope in the Promiſe will ſave undone ſouls. The Promiſe is the ſame to Hope, that<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 24. The Promiſes are Hopes rich Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zin.</note> Hope is to the Soul; the Promiſe is the Anchor of Hope, as Hope is the Anchor of the Soul. Look what the Breſts are to the Childe, and Oyl is to the Lamp, that, are the Promiſes to Hope. Hope lives and thrives, as it feeds upon the Promiſes, as it em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces the Promiſes: The Promiſes are the ſweet-meats of Heaven, upon<note place="margin">Heb. 11. 13.</note> which Hope lives. And every degree of Hope brings a degree of joy into
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:169968:292"/> the Soul, which makes it cry out Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, Heaven.</p>
               <p>Again, Hope is exerciſed about the glory and felicity, the happineſs<note place="margin">Pſal. 16. ult. Tit. 3. 7. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. Looking for Chriſts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as earneſtly as men look and long for the coming of ſome ſpecial friends, or as Inn-keepers do for ſpecial gueſts.</note> and bleſſedneſs that is at Gods right hand. <hi>Tit. 2. 13. Looking for that bleſſed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God, and our Saviour Jeſus Christ.</hi> Hope makes a man ſtretch out his neck, and put forth his hand, and look as earneſtly for the glorious appearing of Chriſt, as <hi>Siſera</hi>'s Mother did for the happy return of her Son. The hoping Soul is often a ſighing it out, Why are his Charriot Wheels ſo long a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>Col 1. 5. For the hope which is laid up for you in Heaven.</hi> Hope in this place<note place="margin">So in Rom. 8. 24, 25. Col. 1. 27. Rom. 5. 2, &amp;c.</note> is taken by a Metonimy, for the things hoped for, <hi>viz.</hi> All that glory and felicity, that bleſſedneſs and happineſs, that is laid up for us in Heaven. So in <hi>Heb. 6. 18. Who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope ſet before us.</hi> Hope here is put for the object of Hope, <hi>viz.</hi> Heaven and Happineſs. Hope layes ſuch faſt hold (as the Greek word here<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>.</note> ſignifies) upon Heaven and Happineſs, that none ſhall ever be able to take thoſe precious things out of Hopes
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:169968:292"/> hand. So Hope is put for the glorious things hoped for, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 18. And thus you ſee thoſe precious and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous objects, about which that Hope that accompanies Salvation is exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That Hope that accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies Salvation, that comprehends Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that borders upon Salvation, is grounded upon the firmeſt foundations, to wit, the Promiſes of God, as hath<note place="margin">Pſal. 40. 4. Prov. 10. 28.</note> been fully ſhewed before; and it is built upon the <hi>Free-grace of God, 1 Pet.</hi> 1. 13. It is built upon the <hi>infinite and glorious power of God, Rom.</hi> 4. 21. It is built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>truth and faithfulneſs of God, 2 Tim.</hi> 2. 13. Theſe precious and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Foundations do bear up the hopes of the Saints, as the three Pillars bore up the hangings in the Tabernacle. A Believers hope is founded upon the Love of Chriſt, the Blood of Chriſt, the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of Chriſt, and the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But the hopes of Hypocrites, and wicked men, are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways built upon weak, ſlender, and ſandy foundations; ſometimes they build their hopes upon their outward
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:169968:293"/> profeſſion, upon their Lamps, though<note place="margin">Matth. 25. 3.</note> they are empty Lamps; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times upon their duties and ſervices, as<note place="margin">Iſai 58 1, 2, 3. Matth. 6. Every falſe principle in Religion is a Reed of <hi>Egypt</hi> that will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly deceive ſouls at laſt; therefore take heed of lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon any of thoſe Reeds.</note> the Jews, Scribes, and Phariſees did; and ſometimes upon their outward priviledges, crying out, <hi>The Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord;</hi> and ſometimes they build their hopes upon others good opinion of them; and ſometimes upon flaſhes of joy; and ſometimes upon enlargements in du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and ſometimes upon the heat and vigor of their ſpirits in Religious ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And all theſe are but ſandy foundations, and they that build their hope upon them will certainly fall, and great will be their fall. The hopes of the Saints are built upon the ſureſt and the ſtrongeſt foundations. It was a good ſaying of one of the Ancients, <hi>I</hi>

               <p>Fourthly, That Hope that accom<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>panies Salvation, that borders upon Salvation, that comprehends Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that brings Salvation, may be known from all falſe hopes, by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent properties of it, and they are theſe that follow.</p>
               <p>The firſt property of that Hope that accompanies Salvation, is this, It<note place="margin">Matth 6. 20, 21. Phil 3. 20, Col 3. 1. Mark, wicked mens hopes never raiſe them as high as Heaven, un<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>der all their hopes they are as very e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, and as great ſtrangers to God, Chriſt, and Heaven, as ever.</note> elevates and raiſes the heart to live a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, where its treaſure is: This Hope is from above, and it makes the heart to live above; it is a ſpark of glory, and it leads the heart to live in glory. Divine hope carries a man to Heaven; for life to quicken him, and for wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to direct him, and for power to uphold him, and for righteouſneſs to juſtifie him, and for holineſs to ſancti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fie him, and for mercy to forgive him and for aſſurance to rejoyce him, and for happineſs to crown him. Divine hope takes in the pleaſures of Heaven
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:169968:294"/> before hand, it lives in the joyful ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of them, it fancies to it ſelf (as I may ſay) the pleaſures and joyes of eternity, and lives in a ſweet anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation of what it poſſeſſeth by Faith. Hopes richeſt treaſures, and choiceſt friends, and chiefeſt delights, and ſweeteſt contents, are in the Country above, and therefore Hope loves beſt to live there moſt.</p>
               <p>A ſecond property of that Hope that accompanies Salvation, is this, It will ſtrengthen the Soul againſt all af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, oppoſitions, and temptations,<note place="margin">Dan. 3. 57. Pſal. 4. 6, 7. Heb. 10 34. &amp; 11. 2 Cor. 4. 16, 17, 18.</note> 1 <hi>Theſ. 5. 8. But let us who are of the day, be ſober, putting on the breſt-plate of faith, and love, and for an helmet, the hope of ſalvation.</hi> Look as the Helmet defends and ſecures the head, ſo doth Hope de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend and ſecure the heart: Hope is a Helmet that keeps off all darts that Satan or the world caſts at the Soul. The hopes of heavenly riches made<note place="margin">It was a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Cardinal that ſaid, He would not leave his part in <hi>Paris,</hi> for a part in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe.</note> thoſe worthies, in that eleventh of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> to deſpiſe the riches of this world; The hopes they had of a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Countrey, made them willing to leave their own Countrey, and to live in the very Land of Promiſe, as in a
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:169968:294"/> ſtrange Countrey. The hopes they had of poſſeſſing (at laſt) a houſe not made with hands, but eternal in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, made them willingly and cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to live in deſerts, and in moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and in dens, and caves of the Earth. The hopes they had of a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Reſurrection, made them couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to withſtand the ſtrongeſt temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> A Saints hope will out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live<note place="margin">Rom. 5. 2, 3, 4, 5. Some are veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſwaded that the want of this Divine hope hath been the reaſon that many among the Heathen have laid vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent hands up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on themſelves. See <hi>Plutarch</hi> in <hi>Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toes</hi> lives. Heb. 11. 10, 14, 16, 25, 32, compared.</note> all fears and cares, all tryals and troubles, all afflictions, and tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Saints have much in hope, though little in hand, they have much in reverſion, though but little in poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, they have much in the promiſe, though but little in the purſe. A Saint can truly ſay, (<hi>Spero meliora</hi>) my hopes are better then my poſſeſſions. Hope can ſee Heaven through the thickeſt clouds; Hope can ſee light through darkneſs, life through death, ſmiles through frowns, and glory through miſery: Hope holds life and ſoul toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it holds Chriſt and the Soul to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, it holds the Soul and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes together, it holds the Soul and Heaven together, and ſo it makes a Chriſtian to ſtand and triumph over
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:169968:295"/> all afflictions, oppoſitions, and temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</p>
               <p>A third property of that Hope that accompanies Salvation, is this, It makes the Soul lively and active, <hi>Pſal. 119. 166. Lord, I have hoped for thy ſalvation, and done thy commandments.</hi> Hope puts the Soul upon doing, upon obeying. 1 <hi>Pet. 1. 3. Bleſſed be the God, and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, which according to his abundant</hi> (or, <hi>much) mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi>

                  <hi>hath begotten us again unto a lively hope, by the reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt from the dead.</hi> It is called a lively hope,<note place="margin">A mans duties<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſervices, u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually are as his hopes are, if his hopes are weak and low, ſo will his ſervices be; but if his hopes are ſpiritual, noble, and high, ſo will his mo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tions and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons be. Divine hope makes Saints as far excel all other men in their actings, as the Angels do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel them. Some ſay hope and faſting are the two wings of Prayer; faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is but as the wing of a bird, but hope is as the wing of an Angel, bearing our prayers to the throne of Grace.</note> becauſe it brings life and comfort into the Soul; and it is called a lively hope, in oppoſition to the withering and dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hopes of Hypocrites, and wicked men; and it is called a lively hope, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it flows from lively cauſes, <hi>viz.</hi> The Spirit of Chriſt, and the Souls union and communion with Chriſt; but mainly it is called a lively hope, becauſe it puts the Soul upon lively en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavors. Hope will make a man pray as for life, hear as for life, and mourn as for life, and obey as for life, and work and walk as for life: Hope will not ſay, this work is too hard, and that
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:169968:295"/> work is too hot; this work is too high, and the other work is too low: Hope will make a man put his hand to every work; Hope makes a man more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion then notion, it makes a man bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at doing then at ſaying, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Hope gives life and ſtrength to all religious duties and ſervices. 1 <hi>Cor. 9. 10. He that plougheth ſhould plough in hope; and he that threſheth in hope, ſhall be partaker of his hope.</hi> Hope will put a Chriſtian upon ploughing and threſhing, that is, upon the hardeſt and difficulteſt ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices for God and his glory. If fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly<note place="margin">Fleſhly hopes put the <hi>Romans</hi> upon doing very ſtrange and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful exploits, as you may ſee in <hi>Plutarch,</hi> and other Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorians.</note> hopes of gaining the honors, riches, and favors of this world, made <hi>Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lom, Ahitophel, Jehu, Haman,</hi> and many Heathens, full of life and activity, full of motion and action: Verily, holy and heavenly hopes will make men much more lively and active, by how much heavenly hopes are more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent then earthly. A man full of hope will be full of action; a lively hope, and a diligently hand, are inſeparable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions. Hope will make a man do, though he dies for doing.</p>
               <p>A fourth property of that Hope that accompanies Salvation, is this, It
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:169968:296"/> will make a man ſit, <hi>Noah</hi> like, quiet and ſtill in the midſt of all ſtorms and tempeſts, in the midſt of all combuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, concuſſions, and mutations; when others are at their wits end, then hope will houſe the Soul, and lodge it ſafe and quiet in the boſom of God, <hi>Job 11. 18.

Sayes Hope, Chriſt knows his<note place="margin">The Lord ſhews much mercy in ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming our mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies for us.</note> own time, and his own time is beſt; though he ſtayes long, yet he will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly come, and he will not ſtay a moment beyond the time he hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixt;
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:169968:297"/> and therefore, ſayes Hope, be not weary, O Soul, but ſtill wait pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently upon the Lord. 1 <hi>Theſ. 1. 3.

Look as Faith gives life and ſtrength to Hope, ſo doth Hope give life and ſtrength to Patience: Therefore Patience is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Patience of Hope. Hope main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains Patience, as the Fuel maintains the Fire.</p>
               <p>A ſixth property of that Hope that accompanies Salvation, is this, It is Soul-purifying Hope, it puts a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an upon purifying himſelf, as Chriſt is pure, 1 <hi>John 3. 3. And every man that hath this hope in him, purifieth himſelf, even as Chriſt is pure.</hi> Divine hope runs<note place="margin">In quality, though not in equality.

The Greek word (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) that is rendred <hi>purifieth,</hi> is a Metaphor
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:169968:298"/> taken, either from the Ceremonial purifications in time of the Law, or elſe from Goldſmiths purifying Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals from their Droſs; and it notes thus much to us, That thoſe that have hopes to reign with Chriſt in glory, that have ſet their hearts upon that pure and bliſsful State, that Paradiſe, that holy and ſpiritual State of Bliſs that is made up of ſingleneſs and puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, they will purifie both their inſides, and their outſides, both body and ſoul, that they may anſwer to that excellent Copy that Chriſt hath ſet before them; knowing, that none ſhall enjoy Everlaſting Glory, but thoſe that labor after perfect pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
               <p>Now Hope purifies the heart and life thus, by keeping the pureſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, as God, Chriſt, the Word, and the Soul together; and by making<note place="margin">How lively Hope makes the Soul in Religious ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, I have ſhewed in the third property.</note> the Soul ſerious and conſcientious in the uſe of all Soul-purifying Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances; and by being a fire in the Soul, to burn up all thoſe corruptions, and principles of darkneſs, that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to that purity and glory that Hope hath in her eye; and by work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:169968:298"/> the Soul to lean upon Chriſt, to live in Chriſt, and to draw purifying vertue from Chriſt, who is the Spring and Fountain of all Purity and San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity. And thus Hope purifies thoſe that expect to be like to Chriſt in Glory.</p>
               <p>The ſeventh and laſt property of that Hope that accompanies Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that comprehends Salvation, is this, It is permanent and laſting, it<note place="margin">Prov. 10. 28. <hi>Auſtins</hi> hope made him long to die, that he might ſee that head that was once crowned with thorns.</note> will never leave the Soul, till it hath lodged it in the boſome of Chriſt. <hi>Prov. 14. 32.

               <p>The firſt Caution, is this, That all<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Caution.</hi> 1. The Scripture tells you of Saints of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſizes, ſome are babes, ſome are children, ſome are yong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, ſome are old men; now all theſe do no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py is he that hath the leaſt degree.</note> Saints have not theſe things that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company Salvation, in the ſame degree; if thou haſt but the leaſt meaſure or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of that Knowledge that accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies Salvation, or of that Faith that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companies Salvation, or of that Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, or of that Obedience, or of that Love, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that accompanies Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, thou mayeſt be as aſſuredly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident of thy Salvation, as if thou waſt already in Heaven. The leaſt degree, O Chriſtian, of thoſe things that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company Salvation, will certainly yeeld thee a Heaven hereafter, and why then ſhould it not yeeld thee a Heaven here? It will undoubtedly yeeld thee a Crown at laſt, and why ſhould it not yeeld thee Comfort and

               <p>The ſecond Caution is this, Though<note place="margin">

It is not always day with the Saints.</note> thou doeſt not finde every one of thoſe things in thee that do accompany Salvation, yet if thou doeſt finde ſome of thoſe things, I, though but a few of thoſe things, yea, though but one of thoſe things that accompanies Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, that comprehends Salvation, that borders upon Salvation, thy eſtate is ſafe, and happineſs will be thy por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at laſt. Thy ſenſe and feeling of one of thoſe precious things that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companies Salvation, ſhould be of more power to work thee to conclude, that thy eſtate is good, then any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing ſhould work thee to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that all is naught, and that thou ſhalt miſcarry at laſt. Do not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ſide with ſin and Satan, againſt thine own precious Soul.</p>

               <p>Sixthly, A wel-grounded Aſſurance of Gods love, and of a mans Everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                  </label> of the Spirit, from the hiſſing of the old Serpent, &amp;c. by theſe follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things, which I deſire that you would ſeriouſly conſider, as you ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the peace, and ſettlement, the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, conſolation, and ſalvation of your own ſouls.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The Spirit of Chriſt doth not witneſſe by any outward voice, as God<note place="margin">Matth 3. ult.

In 1 <hi>King.</hi> 19. you read of <hi>a great ſtrong wind that rent the</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verſ. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>Mountains, and brake in peeces the Rocks: but the Lord was not in the wind: and after the wind there was an earthquake, but the Lord was not in the earthquake. And after the earthquake a fire, but the</hi>

                  <hi>there was a ſtill ſmall voyce,</hi> and the Lord ſpake to <hi>Elijah</hi> in that ſtill ſmall voice.

               <p>Secondly, The teſtimony and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Spirit of Chriſt is onely
<pb n="567" facs="tcp:169968:311"/> gained &amp; enjoyed in holy and heavenly waies, as you may clearly ſee by compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring<note place="margin">Acts 10. 4. Dan. 9. 20. 21, 22. Iſa 64. 5. Act. 10. 44, &amp;c.</note> the Scriptures in the margent to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. The Spirit of the Lord is a holy ſpirit, &amp; he cannot, he wil not make any report of the love of the Father to the ſoule out of a way of holineſſe. Veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all thoſe glorious reports that many boaſt they have met with, in ſinfull waies, in wretched and ungodly waies, are from the hiſſing of the old Serpent, and not from the whiſperings of the<note place="margin">Yet this age hath many ſuch Monſters.</note> Spirit of Grace. I think it is little leſs then blaſphemy, for any to affirm, that the bleſſed Spirit of Chriſt doth make reports of the love and favour of God, to perſons walking in waies of wicked<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neſſe and baſeneſſe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The teſtimony and witneſs of the Spirit of Chriſt, is a clear, a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ul, a ſatisfying teſtimony and witneſſe, the ſoul ſits down under the home reports<note place="margin">John 14 17. 1 John 3. 24.</note> of the Spirit, &amp; ſaith, Lord it is enough, the ſoul being full ſits down and ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſings it out, <hi>My beloved is mine, and</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cant. 2. 16. &amp; 7. 10.</note>

                  <hi>and the lot of mine inheritance. I have none in Heaven but thee, neither is there

                  <note place="margin">Cant. 8. ult.</note> 
                  <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Such power, majeſty, and glory attends the glorious teſtimony of the Spirit of Chriſt, as ſcatters all clouds, as reſolves all doubts, as anſwers all objections, as ſilences the wrangl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſoul, &amp;c. If the teſtimony of the Spirit of Chriſt were not a ful ſatisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing teſtimony, it could never fill the ſoule with ſuch joy as is unſpeakable and full of glory, and with ſuch peace as paſſes underſtanding; if the teſtimony were not ſatisfactory the ſoul would ſtill be under fears and doubts, the heart would ſtill be a wrangling and quarrelling, I may periſh, and I may be undone, I may have the door of Mercy ſhut againſt me, &amp;c. If you bring news to a condemned perſon that the King hath pardoned him, and that he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him to favor, and confer ſuch and ſuch dignity upon him, yet this doth not quiet him, nor ſatisfie him, till he knows it is the Kings act, till he is ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied in that, he cannot ſay it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, he cannot be chearfull, hee cannot be delightful. &amp;c. But when
<pb n="569" facs="tcp:169968:312"/> hee is ſatisfied that it is the Kings act, that the King hath certainly done this, and that for him, then he is ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, and then ſighing and mourning flies away, and then he rejoyces with joy unſpeakable. So it is with a belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Soul under the teſtimony and witneſs of the Spirit of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Though the Spirit be a witneſſing Spirit, yet he doth not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies witneſs to beleevers their adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, their intereſt in Chriſt, &amp;c. There is a mighty difference between the working of the Spirit, and the witneſs of the Spirit; There are often times many glorious and efficacious works of the Spirit, as Faith, Love, Repon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,<note place="margin">Iſa. 50. 10.</note> Holineſſe, &amp;c. where there is not the witneſs of the Spirit. <hi>David</hi> at that very time had the Spirit. and<note place="margin">Pſa. 50. 10, 11, 12</note> many ſweet workings of the Spirit in him, and upon him, when he had by ſin loſt the witneſs and teſtimony of the Spirit. Though the Spirit of the Lord be a witneſſing and a ſealing Spirit, yet he doth not alwaies wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs<note place="margin">Job 23. 8, 9. 1 Joh. 5. 13. Pſa 88. Pſa. 77. Mich. 7. 8, 9. Iſa. 8. 17.</note> and ſeal up the love and favor of the Father to beleevers ſouls, as you may ſee by the Scriptures in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,
<pb n="570" facs="tcp:169968:313"/> and as the experience of many precious Chriſtians can abundantly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence. All beleevers do not ſee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like need of this teſtimony, they doe not all alike prize this teſtimony, they do not all alike obſerve it and improve it, and therefore it is no wonder if the Spirit be a witneſſing Spirit to ſome, and not to others: You do but gratifie Satan, and wrong your owne ſoules, when you argue that certainly you have not the Spirit becauſe he is not a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſing and a ſealing Spirit to your ſoules. Though it be the office of the Spirit to witneſs, yet it is not his office alwayes to witneſs to beleevers their happineſs and bleſſedneſs: The Spirit may act one way &amp; in one room of the<note place="margin">A man may be a doing in one Room, when he is not in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother: So is the Spirit in the heart of a Saint.</note> ſoul, when he doth not act in another; ſometimes the Spirit works upon the Underſtanding, ſometimes upon the Will, ſometimes upon the Affections, ſometimes upon Faith, ſometimes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Fear, ſometimes upon Love, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times upon Humility, &amp;c. Our hearts are the Spirits Harps; If a man ſhould alwaies touch one ſtring in an Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he ſhould never play various tunes, he ſhould never make pleaſant
<pb n="571" facs="tcp:169968:313"/> muſick; no more would the Spirit, it he ſhould be alwaies a doing one thing in the ſoule; therefore he acts vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, ſometimes he will ſhew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe a quickning Spirit, ſometimes an enlightning Spirit, ſometimes an humbling Spirit, ſometimes a rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Spirit, ſometimes a ſealing Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and alwayes a ſurporting Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, The teſtimony and witneſs of the Spirit, is a ſure teſtimony, a<note place="margin">Titus 1. 2. John 14. 17. 1 Cor. 2. 10<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1 Joh. 4. 1, 2, 3, 4</note> ſure witneſs, the Spirit is truth it ſelf, he is the great ſearcher of the deep things of God, the Spirit of the Lord is the Diſcoverer, the Confuter, and Deſtroyer of all falſe ſpirits. The Spirit is above all poſſibility of being deceived; he is omnipotent, he is om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſcient, he is omnipreſent, he is one of the Cabinet-Councel of Heaven, he lies, and lives in the boſome of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and can call them all by name up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whom the Father hath ſet his heart, and therefore his teſtimony muſt needs be true. It is a ſurer teſtimony then if a man ſhould hear a voice from Heaven pronouncing him to be happy and bleſſed. You may ſafely and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely
<pb n="572" facs="tcp:169968:314"/> lay the weight of your ſouls upon this teſtimony, it never hath, it never will deceive any that hath lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon it. This teſtimony will be a rock that will bear up a ſoul, When other falſe teſtimonies will be but a reed of <hi>Egypt,</hi> that will deceive the ſoul, that will undoe the ſoul; As I am afraid many in this deluding age have found by ſad experience.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, The teſtimony of Gods<note place="margin">I do not ſay that the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of our ſpirits is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with the teſtimony of the Spirit; No, for a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever hath of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the ſingle teſtimony of his own ſpirit, when he wants the teſtimony of the Spirit of Chriſt, and the ſingle te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of his own conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, wil afford him much cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, 2 Cor. 1. 12. Yea, it wil make a paradiſe of delight in his ſoul, &amp;c.</note> Spirit is alwayes accompanied with the teſtimony of our own, theſe may be diſtinguiſhed, but they can never be ſeparated; when the Spirit of God gives in witneſſe for a man, his own ſpirit doth not give in witneſſe againſt him. Look as face anſwers to face, ſo doth the witneſs of a Beleevers ſpirit anſwer to the witneſs of the Spirit of Chriſt, <hi>Rom. 8. 16. The Spirit witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth together with our ſpirits that we be the Sons of God.</hi> Now if our own Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences do not teſtifie firſt, that we are Sons and Heirs, the Spirit doth not teſtifie, for the Spirit beares witneſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with our ſpirits; St. <hi>John</hi> is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry expreſſe in 1 <hi>Joh. 3. 21. But if our hearts condemn us not, then have we confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="573" facs="tcp:169968:314"/> toward God. But if our hearts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn us, God is greater then our hearts, and knoweth all things, 1 Joh.</hi> 5. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. And <hi>there are three that bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in Earth, the Spirit, and the Water, and the Blood, and theſe three agree in one.</hi> The Spirit doth witneſs eminently and efficiently, but Water and Blood ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terially, and our ſpirits and Reaſon, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentally. By the Spirit we may underſtand the Holy Ghoſt, by whoſe ſtrength wee lay hold on Chriſt; and all his benefits; by Water we may underſtand our Regeneration, our Sanctification; and by Blood we may underſtand the blood and righteouſneſs of Chriſt, that is imputed and apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by faith to us; and theſe three agree in one, that is, they doe all three of one accord teſtifie the ſame thing.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, The witneſs of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is ever according to the Word; there is a ſweet harmony between the inward and outward teſtimony, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Spirit of God and the VVord of God. The Scriptures were<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 20, 21.</note> all indicted by the Spirit, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Spirit cannot contradict him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
<pb n="574" facs="tcp:169968:315"/> which he ſhould do, if he ſhould give in any teſtimony contrary to the teſtimony of the word. It is blaſphemy to make the teſtimony of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>pirit to contradict the teſtimony of the Word. The Spirit hath revealed his whole mind in the Word, and he will not give a contrary teſtimony to what he hath given in the Word. The Word ſaith, they that are born again, that are new Creatures, that beleeve and repent, ſhall be ſaved: But thou art born again, thou art a new Creature, thou beleeveſt and repenteſt; therefore thou ſhalt be ſaved ſaith the Spirit: The Spirit never looſeth, where the Word bindeth; the Spirit never ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifies, where the Word condemnes; the Spirit never approves, where the Word diſapproves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Spirit never bleſſes, where the VVord curſes. In<note place="margin">Deu. l 3. 1, 2, 3, 4</note> the Old Teſtament, all Revelations were to be examined by the VVord, <hi>Iſa. 8. 20. To the Law and to the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi>

                  </note> 
                  <hi>if they ſpeak not according to this Word, it is becauſe there is no light</hi> (or no mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning) <hi>in them.</hi> So in that of <hi>John</hi> 16.<note place="margin">We are not only blind but lame too, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Spirit ſhall lead us to the knowledge and practice of all neceſſary ſaving truths.</note> 13. <hi>The Spirit ſhall lead you into all truth, for he ſhall not ſpeak of himſelfe,
<pb n="575" facs="tcp:169968:315"/> but what he ſhall hear<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that ſhall he ſpeak.</hi> Here the Holy Ghoſt is brought in as ſome Meſſenger or Ambaſſador who onely relates things faithfully, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that he hath in charge. Such as look and lean upon the hiſſing of the old Serpent, may have a teſtimony that they are happy, againſt the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the VVord; But where ever the Spirit of Chriſt gives in his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, it is ſtil according to the VVord. Look, as Indenture anſwers to Inden<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ture, or as the Counterpaine exactly anſwers to the principall Conveyance, there is Article for Article, Clauſe for Clauſe, Covenant for Covenant, word for word: So doth the teſtimony of the Spirit exactly anſwer to the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the VVord.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, It is a Holy witneſs, a holy<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Nil niſi ſanctu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> à ſancto spiritu prodire poteſt,</hi> Nothing can come from the Holy Spirit but that which is holy.</note> teſtimony, it is formally holy, it is origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally holy, it is effectually holy. Nothing makes the heart more in the love, ſtudy, practiſe and growth of holines, then the glorious teſtimony of the Holy Spirit; and the more clear &amp; ful the teſtimony is, the more holy and gracious it will make the Soule. Nothing puts ſuch golden Engagements upon the ſoul to
<pb n="576" facs="tcp:169968:316"/> holineſs, as the Spirit ſealing a man up to the day of Redemption, as the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits ſpeaking and ſealing Peace. Love, and pardon to the Soul, <hi>Pſal. 85. 8. 1 Cor. 15. 31. 2 Cor.</hi> 5. 14. Nothing makes a man more careful to pleaſe Chriſt, more fearful to offend Chriſt, more ſtudious to exalt Chriſt, and more circumſpect to walk with Chriſt, then this teſtimony of the Spirit of Chriſt. Verily, that is not the bleſſed whiſpering of Chriſts Spirit, but the hiſſing of the old Serpent, that makes men bold with ſin, that makes men dally with ſin, that makes man a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to ſin, that breeds a contempt of Ordinances, a neglect of holy Duties, a careleſneſs in walking with God; And from thoſe hiſſings of the old Serpent, O Lord, deliver my Soul, and the Souls of all thy ſervants that put their truſt in thee.</p>
               <p>Ninethly and laſtly, Aſſurance is a Jewel, a Pearl of that price, that God onely beſtows it upon renued hearts. The Spirit never ſets his Seal upon any, but upon thoſe that Chriſt hath firſt<note place="margin">Revel 2. 17. Ezek. 36. 25, 26, 27. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared.</note> printed his Image upon: God gives to none the white ſtone, but to thoſe
<pb n="577" facs="tcp:169968:316"/> from whom he hath taken the heart of ſtone. Chriſt never tells a man that his Name is written in the Book of<note place="margin">Luke 10. 20.</note> Life, till he hath breathed into him Spiritual Life. Chriſt never ſayes, Son be of good chear, thy ſin is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned,<note place="margin">Luke 5. 18, 19, 20.</note> till he hath firſt ſaid, Be thou healed, be thou cleanſed.

<pb n="578" facs="tcp:169968:317"/> A Soul ſealed by the Spirit will pull out right eyes, and cut off right hands, for Chriſt; ſuch a Soul will part with a <hi>Benjamin,</hi> and offer up an <hi>Iſaac,</hi> for Chriſt.

                  <hi>we have, after much praying, weeping and waiting, gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this Pearl of price, Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance: But, O how ſhall we do to ſtrengthen it? How ſhall we do to keep it? Satan will labor to weaken our Aſſurance, and to rob us of this Jewel, that is more worth than a world; what means muſt we uſe to ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en our Aſſurance, and to ſecure it? &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now to this Queſtion, I ſhall give theſe following Anſwers.</p>
               <p>Firſt, If you would have your Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance ſtrengthned and maintained, then keep cloſe to Soul-ſtrengthning<note place="margin">The old Rule was <hi>Hoc age.</hi>
                  </note> ways, be ſerious and ſincere, be dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent and conſtant in the uſe of thoſe means and ways wherein you firſt gained Aſſurance, as Prayer, the Word,
<pb n="580" facs="tcp:169968:318"/> breaking of Bread, Communion of Saints, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> A conſcionable and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial<note place="margin">A cool ſpirit is always a loſing ſpirit, the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heart, the diligent heart, turns the ſpark into a flame, the mite into a million, &amp;c.</note> uſe of holy and heavenly means is bleſſed, not onely with a preſervation of Aſſurance, but likewiſe with an addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and increaſe of it. The ways of God, and his goings in the Sanctuary, have wrought wonders upon thee, when thou waſt dead, how much more will they work upon thee, and for thee, now thou art (by Grace made) alive? He that will not apply himſelf to Gods ſtrengthning methods, will quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly finde his Aſſurance weakned, if not wholly waſted. He that thinks him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf too good for Ordinances, will quickly grow weak in his Aſſurance. The choiceſt Prophets, and higheſt A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles (if I may ſo ſpeak) that had attained to the fulleſt Aſſurance, kept cloſe to the ways and precious inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions of Chriſt. Verily, thoſe that pretend to live above Ordinances, and yet live below them, never knew by experience, what a mercy it was to have a wel-grounded Aſſurance, or elſe they have loſt that bleſſed Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance that once they had, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, If you would ſtrengthen
<pb n="581" facs="tcp:169968:318"/> and maintain your Aſſurance, then dwell much upon your Spiritual and Eternal Priviledges, <hi>viz.</hi> Your A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption,<note place="margin">Holy and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, are the food by which Aſſurance is cheriſhed and maintained.</note> Juſtification, Reconciliation, <hi>&amp;c. 1 Pet.</hi> 2. 9. This you will finde by experience will mightily tend to the ſtrengthning and maintaining of your Aſſurance. He that neglects this Rule, will quickly finde his Sun to ſet in a cloud, his Harp to be turned into mourning, and his Organ into the voice<note place="margin">Job 30. ult.</note> of them that weep.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, If you would ſtrengthen and maintain your Aſſurance, then look that your hearts and thoughts run more out to Chriſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> then to Aſſurance, to the Sun then to the Beams, to the Fountain then to the Stream, to the Root then to the Branch, to the Cauſe then to the Effect. Aſſurance is ſweet,<note place="margin">Cant. 1. 13.</note> but Chriſt is more ſweet. Aſſurance is lovely, but Chriſt is altogether love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.<note place="margin">Cant. 5. 16. Prov 3. 15.</note> Aſſurance is precious, but Chriſt is moſt precious. Though Aſſurance be a flower that yeelds much comfort and delight, yet it is but a flower. Though Aſſurance be a precious Box, yet it is but a Box. Though Aſſurance be a Ring of Gold, yet it is but a Ring
<pb n="582" facs="tcp:169968:319"/> of Gold. And what is the flower to the Root, what is the Box to the Oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, what is the Ring to the Pearl? No more is Aſſurance to Chriſt; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let thy eye, and heart, firſt, moſt, and laſt, be fixt upon Chriſt, then will Aſſurance bed and board with thee, otherwiſe thou wilt quickly finde thy Summer to be turned into Winter.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, If you would ſtrengthen and maintain your Aſſurance, then look that your hearts are more taken up with Chriſt, then with your Graces. Though Grace be a glorious Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,<note place="margin">Chriſt is the pot of Manna, the Cruſe of Oyl, the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſs Ocean, the moſt ſpark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Diamond in the Ring of glory, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> yet it is but a Creature; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let Grace have your eye, but be ſure that Chriſt have your heart. Chriſt will not allow your very Graces to be corrivals with him. He that mindes his Graces more then Chriſt, or that ſets his Graces upon the Throne with Chriſt, will quickly finde what it is to loſe the face and favor of Chriſt. Your Grace are but Chriſts Servants and Handmaids, you may look upon them, but you muſt not match with them.<note place="margin">When <hi>Darius</hi> ſent to <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> that he would be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to divide the Kingdom, no ſaith <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi> there is but one Sun in the Firmament, and there can be but one King in a Kingdom: So ſaith Chriſt, &amp;c.</note> It is a reproach to Chriſt, that thoſe that have married the Maſter, ſhould
<pb n="583" facs="tcp:169968:319"/> at the ſame time match with the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant. The Queen may look upon her gliſtering Courtiers, but ſhe muſt live upon the King; the Wife may take pleaſure in her lovely Babes, but ſhe muſt live upon her Husband, and be moſt obſervant of her Husband: So gracious ſouls may look upon their Graces, but they muſt live upon King Jeſus; they may take pleaſure in their Graces, but they muſt live upon Chriſt, and be moſt obſervant of Chriſt. This is the way to keep Chriſt and Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and he that walks contrary to this rule, will ſoon find the loſſe of both. Chriſt will be <hi>Alexander</hi> or <hi>Nemo,</hi> he will be all in all, or he will be nothing at all. Though his Coat<note place="margin">

               <p>Fifthly, If you would have your<note place="margin">We have, ſaith <hi>Cyprian,</hi> no ſuch notions as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers have, but we are Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers in our deeds, we do not ſpeak great things, but we do great things in our lives.</note> Aſſurance ſtrengthened and maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, then labor to improve your Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance, improve it to the ſtrengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of you againſt temptations, to the fencing of you againſt corruptions, to the raiſing of your reſolutions, to the inflaming of your affections, to the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
<pb n="584" facs="tcp:169968:320"/> of your converſations. Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is a pearl of price, he that will keep it, muſt improve it. The ready way to maintain our natural ſtrength, and to increaſe it, is to improve it: So the ready way to maintain our Aſſurance, and to increaſe it, is to improve it. Aſſurance is one of the choiceſt and chiefeſt talents that ever God intruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man with, and he that doth not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it and imploy it, will quickly loſe it, &amp;c. God will not ſuffer ſo<note place="margin">Matth. 25. 28.</note> golden a talent to gather ruſt. Win gold and wear gold, improve gold and keep gold; win Aſſurance and wear Aſſurance, improve Aſſurance and keep Aſſurance. <hi>Dionyſius</hi> the elder, being adviſed of one that had hidden great ſtore of money, commands him upon pain of death to bring it to him; which he did, but not all; But with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder he went and dwelt in another Countrey, where he bought an Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="585" facs="tcp:169968:320"/> make the application.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, If you would have your Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance ſtrengthened and maintained, then walke humbly with your God.<note place="margin">Mich. 6. 8.</note> God makes the humble mans heart his houſe to dwell in, <hi>Iſa. 57. 15.

                  <hi>the high and holy place; with him alſo that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the ſpirit of the humble, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive the heart of the contrite ones.</hi> The higheſt heavens, and the loweſt hearts, are the habitations wherein the holy one delights to dwel. Now this phraſe, <hi>I will dwel with the humble,</hi> takes in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral things. 1. It includes Gods over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looking the humble. 2. It takes in Gods aſſiſting and ſtrengthning of the humble. 3. It takes in Gods protection, <hi>I will dwel with the humble,</hi> that is, I<note place="margin">Job 22. 29.</note> will protect him and ſecure him. 4: It takes in Gods ſympathizing with the humble. 5. It takes in Gods applying<note place="margin">Iſa. 63. 9. Iſa. 57. 18.</note> all ſuitable good to the humble. 6. It takes in Gods ruling and over-ruling the heart and the affections of the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. 7. It takes in Gods teaching and<note place="margin">Pſa. 10. 17. Pſal. 25. 9.</note> learning of the humble. But 8. and
<pb n="586" facs="tcp:169968:321"/> laſtly, it includes and takes in a clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, a fuller, and a larger manifeſtation and communication of God to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſouls; ah ſaith God, I will dwell with the humble, that is, I will more richly, more abundantly, and more gloriouſly manifeſt and make knowne my grace and glory, my goodneſſe and ſweetneſſe, my loving kindneſſe and tenderneſſe to humble ſouls. Now tell me humble ſoules, will not Gods dwelling thus with you contribute very much to the ſtrengthning and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of your Aſſurance? <hi>Jam. 4. 6. But he giveth more grace, wherefore he ſaith, God reſiſteth the proud</hi> (or as the Greek<note place="margin">

                     </gap>.</note> word emphatically ſignifies, he ſets himſelf in battle array againſt the proud) <hi>but giveth grace to the humble.</hi> Humility is both a grace, and a veſſell to receive grace. God poures in grace into the humble ſouls, as men poure liquor into an empty veſſel. And ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, the more grace you have, the more will your Aſſurance be ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and maintained. Well, remember this, the humble mans mercies are the ſweeteſt mercies, the greateſt mercies, the moſt growing and thriving mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
<pb n="587" facs="tcp:169968:321"/> the moſt bleſſed and ſanctified mercies, &amp; the moſt laſting and abiding mercies. Therefore as you would have your Aſſurance ſtrengthned and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, walk humbly with your God; I ſay again, walk humbly, walk humbly with your God, and you ſhal wear the crown of Aſſurance to your grave.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, If you would keep and maintain your Aſſurance, then take heed and watch againſt thoſe very par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſins by which other Saints have loſt their Aſſurance. Take heed of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall confidence and ſecurity. <hi>David</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 30. 6, 7.</note> loſt his Aſſurance by not guarding his heart againſt thoſe evils. Again, take heed of a light, ſlight, careleſs, and negligent ſpirit in holy and ſpirituall things. The Spouſe in the Canticles loſt her Aſſurance, and her ſweet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with Chriſt, by her ſlightneſs of ſpirit. Again, take heed of a ſtout<note place="margin">Cant. 5 2, 3, 6. compared.</note> and unyeelding ſpirit under the afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hand of God, this made God hide his face from them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57. 17. In a word, take heed of taſting of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden fruit, remembring what <hi>Adam</hi> loſt by a taſte.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, If you would maintain
<pb n="588" facs="tcp:169968:322"/> and keep your Aſſurance, then free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently<note place="margin">A man may eaſier make a ſeeing eie blind, then a blind eye to ſee; a man may ſoon put an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument out of tune, but not ſo ſoon put it in again; A man is eaſily born down the ſtream, but cannot ſwim ſo eaſily up the ſtream. &amp;c.</note> and ſeriouſly conſider of the wonderfull difficulty of recovering Aſſurance when it is loſt; Oh the ſighs, the groans, the complaints, the prayers, the tears, the heart-renting, the ſoul-bleeding that the recovery of thy loſt Aſſurance will coſt. The gaming of Aſſurance at firſt coſt thee dear, but the regaining of it (if thou ſhouldeſt be ſo unhappy as to loſe it) will put thee to more pains and charge. Of the two it is eaſier to keep Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance now thou haſt it, then to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover it when thou haſt loſt it.

               <p>I ſhall give a few ſhort Anſwers to this Queſtion, and ſo draw to a cloze.</p>

But this is not all.</p>
               <p>Therefore in the ſecond place, weep<note place="margin">Reve. 2. 4, 5.

               <p>Therefore in the fourth place, wait patiently upon the Lord; <hi>David</hi> did ſo, and at length the Lord brought him<note place="margin">Pſal. 40. 1, 2, 3.</note> out of a <hi>horrible pit,</hi> or out of a pit of noiſe and confuſion, <hi>and ſet his feet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a rock, and establiſhed his goings,</hi> and <hi>put a new Song</hi> of praiſe <hi>into his mouth.</hi> God never hath, nor never will faile the waiting Soul; though God loves to try the patience of his Children, yet he doth not love to tire out the patience of his Children,<note place="margin">Iſa. 57. 16, 18, 19</note> therefore <hi>he will not contend for ever, neither will he be alwaies wroth, leſt the ſpirits of his people ſhould faile.</hi> Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is a Jewel worth waiting for, it is a Pearl that God gives to none but ſuch as have waited long at mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies

               </p>
               <p>Fifthly and laſtly, If you would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover Aſſurance, then take heed of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing Comforts when God brings them to your door, take heed of throwing Goſpel-Cordialls againſt

                  <hi>ſoule refuſed to be comforted.</hi> God comes and offers love to the ſoul, and the ſoule refuſes it; God comes and ſpreads the Promiſes of Conſolation before the Soul, and the Soul refuſes to look upon them; God comes and makes tenders of the riches of grace, and the ſoule refuſes to accept of them. Sometimes the hand, the man that brings the Cordiall is not liked, and therefore men refuſe it. Well, remember this, when gold is offered men care not how great or how baſe he is that offers it; neither ſhould we care by whom the Cordials and conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of the Goſpel are offered to us, whether they are offered by the hand of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> a Prophet of the blood roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, as ſome think, or by <hi>Amos</hi> from amongſt the Heardſmen of <hi>Tekoa.</hi> If the Sweet-meats of Heaven are ſet before thee, it is thy wiſdom and thy duty to taſte of them, and to feed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, without ſtumbling at the hand that preſents them.</p>
               <p>Now for a cloze I ſhall make a few ſhort uſes of what hath been ſaid, and ſo conclude.</p>
               <pb n="603" facs="tcp:169968:329"/>
               <p>Firſt, You that have Aſſurance, be <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Uſe </seg>1</label> thankful for it; it is a Jewel more worth then Heaven, therefore be thankful. Aſſurance is a mercy nobly deſcended, it is from above. Man is<note place="margin">Jam. 1. 17. <hi>Plato</hi> was very thankful, that God made him a man, and not a woman, a Grecian, and not a Barbarian, a Scholar to <hi>Socrates,</hi> and not to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher. O what cauſe then have you to be thankful for Aſſurance?</note> not born with it in his heart, as he is with a tongue in his mouth. Aſſurance is a peculiar mercy, it is a flower of Paradiſe that God ſticks onely in his childrens boſoms. Aſſurance is a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, ſweetning mercy, it is a mercy that puts the Garland upon all our mercies. Aſſurance makes every bitter ſweet, and every ſweet more ſweet; he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyes little, that wants it, he wants nothing that enjoyes it; therefore be you thankful that have, and do finde the ſweetneſs of it. If <hi>Philip</hi> rejoyced that <hi>Alexander</hi> was born in the dayes of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> How much more cauſe have you to rejoyce, upon whoſe heads the Lord hath put the Crown of Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance, a crown of more worth and weight, then all Princes crowns in the world?</p>

The men of the world, are real objects of pitty, but not of envy; who envies the Priſoner at the Bar? who envies the Malefactor that is going to Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? who envies the dead man that is going to his grave? God hath done more for thee by giving thee Aſſurance, then if he had given thee all the world, yea, Ten thouſand worlds.

               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, If God hath given you <label type="milestone">
